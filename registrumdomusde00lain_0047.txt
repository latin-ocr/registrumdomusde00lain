THE HOSPITAL OF SOLTRE. xi

Another change befell Soltre after the Reformation. When Trinity
College Church and Hospital and its revenues were transferred to the Pro-
vost, Magistrates, and Couneil of Edinburgh, Soutra‚ as it was then called,
having eeased to be maintained as a distinet pai-ish church, the place speedily
lost its importance, and the buildings fell into ruins. In the Register of
Ministers 1567, William Frank appears as minister of the united parishes
of Sowtra, Fawlaw‚ and Keithhumbye, with a stipend of 0830 (soom), and
the vicarage teinds of Keithhumbye. In 1574 the two former places were
joined to Creichtoun, of which Adam Johnestoun was minister, with the
aid of three readers. The reader at Soutra had an allowance of 20 merks,
with the kirk-land, or glebe. In 1589 a separation from Creichtoun took
place, and the parishes of Fala and Soutra, although in different counties,¹
were again united under one minister. This arrangement has continued
to the present time, Fala becoming the parish church, and Soutra existing
only in name, or in a few scattered houses‚ the population of the two united
parishcs, according to the last censuS‚ in 1851, being only 4343 the rental
however having greatly increased.

Before concluding these notices, I may add, that no plan or view of the
old Hospital or its ruins can be discovered. On visiting the locality last
autumn, to ascertain if the ruins were such as might serve for a vignette or
illustration to the present volume, I was informed that about ten or twelve
years ago, every vestige of the walls and foundation had been dug up and
carted away for building dykes and farm-steadings in the neighbourhood.
Such has too often been the fate of many of our old Ecclesiastical build-
ings, when in ruins, and standing in isolated positions; the proprietors
being ignorant or indifferent for their preservation, and the tenants glad
to avail themselves of such an easy mode of obtaining building materials.
There still however exists a small aislc of the church converted into a
burying-vault‚ which had a nari-ow escape, as portions of the wall had
