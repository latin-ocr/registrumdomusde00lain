may have been brought from without. There are several burying enclo-
sures round the church, including· that of “the late Ronald Craufurd of
Restalrig, Esquire‚” its door built up with stone3 some of these may likely
enough be of an early date.

In former days the town of Restalrig must have been a place of much
greater importance than might be deemed from the struggling houses of the
present village. WVhether Logan’s house was that known as Lochend, or
on the site of what is now called Restalrig-house, is doubtful.

“At the distance of about a mile (says Maitland) from the Watergate‚
at the foot of the Canongate‚ lies the Lake of Lestalrig, vulgarly Loch-end.
This lake, which is about four hundred yards in length, half as much in
breadth‚ and where deepest about eighty feet, as ’tis said3 and the fish
wherewith it is said to abound are only pikes and ecls.”1 For the King's
sport, no doubt, we find in the Treasurer's accounts, in 1507, ‘⁶ Item, the
xiij day of September (paid) to four men that rowit in ane bote on the
Lough of Restalrig to affray fowles, vs.” During the siege of Leith, in
1559-60, Bishop Lesley states, that “the Lord Gray, Lieutenant of the
Inglis army ludged in Lestalrig town in the Deanis house, and many of all
thair hors and demi-lances.’'2 A house, with a small garden, not far from the
east end of the existing church, still retains the name of the Dean’s House.
The old house of Craigentinny, in the immediate vicinity‚ formerly giving
a title to the family of Nisbet, is of the fifteenth century.

Before passing from Restalrig to Corstorphine, it may be proper to add
a few words regarding the parish Church of Son'rn me. This old fabric,
which was restored and somewhat remodelled in 1845, was erected towards
the close of the fifteenth century. Chalmers, who calls it ‘⁶ the chapel of
the Virgin,'’ says it had existed a century and a half before 1560. That there
may have been such a chapel is by no means improbable, but some of
his references expressly call it the Virgin Mary’s Kirkt, as in 1490, when
