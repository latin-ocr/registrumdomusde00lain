TRINITY COLLEGE, EDINBURGH. xxix

sters of Edinburgh, for the education of youth were included, and also to
increase the funds of the newly erected College orrUniversity of Edinburgh.
As explanatory of these purposeS‚ there is printed at p. 246, No. 220, the
original Signature by King J ὅπως, of confirmation and Novodamus of all the
Kirk Livings, to the vaost, Magistrates, and Council of Edinburgh‚ dated
7th August 1612, upon which a Charter under the Great Seal was passed.
But previously to this, probably about the year 1580, the building itself was
converted into a parochial church, and obtained the name of the North-East
parish church of Edinburgh. The first minister was Walter Balcanquall.
In 1574, he was one of the three ministers of Edinburgh 3 in 1588, there were
four; but owing to the increased population, the town in 1598 was divided

works connected with the history of Edinburgh, or the ecclesiastical anti-
quities of Scotland. Its site has already been described, and the accom-

in 1814, with details supplied from the very accurate plans by Mr. Bryce
in 1848, when the church was demolished, exhibits the adjoining localities
as they existed half a century ago, and may be compared with the wood-
cut at p. xiv, copied from Gordon's map of Edinburgh 1647. The Eastern
portion of the North Loch had nearly two centur-ies ago been drained, and
converted into the “ Physick Gardens‚” while another portion of the ground
belonging to the church was, in 1772, granted for the erection of Lady> Glen-
orcliy's ChapeL which had an injurious effect by circumscribing its limits‚
and enclosing it with a dead wall. But these buildings, as well as Trinity
College and Hospital, have all been swept away, when the ground was
