THE KIRK OF FIELD. xxxv

North side os the King’s street. In 1531, another Royal chartei· confirms
the mortification by Dame Janet Kennedy, Lady Bothwcll‚ of some tenc-
ments in Edinburgh and an annual sum of 205. for a prebendary officiating
in the College Church of the blessed Virgin Mary in the Fields, within tlte
walls of the burgh of Edinburgh3 the city wall having recently been cx—
tended in that direction. This Lady, who was the daughter of John Lord
Kennedy, derived her title from a. grant by Archibald, Earl of Augus (her
supposed husband), of a liferent of the Lordship of Bothwel]‚ 'fth of Feb-
ruary 1509-10, and confirmed the same day by a chartei· under the Great
Seal.l Before her alleged marriage, she had a natural son by King James
the Fourth‚ who, in 1515, was created Earl of Murray.

The person who first held the office of Provost of the Church, “ Praepo-
situs Ecclesiae collegiatae nostre Domine de Campis prope Edinburgh,” was
MATTHEW ΚΕΗ, Master of Arts. His name occurs among the licentiates of
the University of Paris in the year 1498, and he is designed of the diocese of
Glasgow. On his return to Scotland he was preferred to the Vicarage of
l'etircultcr‚ and afterwards to the Kirk of Field. He also acted as deputy
‹›fRobert Forman, Commissary-General, in the Official Court of the diocese
of St. Andrcws‚ in deciding matrinionial cases? He was probably dead in
1520, as we find Sir Alexander Coupar, chaplain and prebendary, acting
for the rest of his brethren.

The second Provost appears to have been Mr. RchARD BoTHviLE or
BoTHWELL‚ who, as much by his own talent for public employment as by
family influence, obtained his full share of preferment. He was the second
son of Richard BothwelL Provost of Edinburgh in the reign of King
James the Third.3 He was cducated for the church, and his name, in
the year 1500, occurs in the old Registers of the University of Paris,
where he probably took his degrees in law, At an early period of life
he obtained a prebend in the Cathedral Church of Glasgow‚ and became
