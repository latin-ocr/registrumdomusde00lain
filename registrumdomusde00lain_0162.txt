of our Souerane Lord or his successouris, &c At Edinburgh, the xv day of Februare,
the zeir forsaid [1539-40.]⁷’1 At the Provincial Assembly held at Edinburgh in 1549,
among the Bishops present was ‘⁴ KVillelmus electus Lismorensis confirmatus⁹³ This
might seem as if Onnningham had only recently, owing either to want of interest 01·
some contending claim, obtained his confirmation to the See. While Cunningham was
Bishop of Argyll, he obtained, under the Privy SeaL “ a letter maid to William Bishop
of Ergile, his airis and assignais, off the gift of non-entres, males⁷ fermes, proffittis, and
dewiteis of all and sindrie, the landis and baronyes of Kilmawris‚ Stewinstoun,
Ramferly, Fyndlaystoun, dcc„ in our Soveranis handis⁷ or his graces predecessouris or
Superioriris be resson of non-entres sen the deceis of umquhill Robert Erle of Glencairne,
Cuthbert, or William Erlis of Glencarne, or ony of thame, 24th April 1550.”·2 Wil-
liam was bishop in Jannary1554-53 but whether in consequence of death or resigna—
tion, J ames Hamiltou, a natural brother of J ames Duke of Chattelherault, had become
Bishop of Argyle in 1558. It is probable that this was effected by an arrangement,
which secured “ to Mr. William Cunningliam”3 the pensiori of the Subdeanry of Glasgow.

1579-80.

THOMAs Emmsn, eldest son of Sir Thomas Erskine‚ Secretary‚ obtained a presen-
tation to the vacant Provostry of Trinity College, 17th February 1538-9, according to
the following notice in the Privy Seal Registerz—“Presentatio Thome Erskin super
prepositura Ecclesie Collegiate Sancte Trinitatis prope burgum de Edinburgh nunc
vacante aut quo tempore eadem vacare contigerit per resignationem cessionem aut
dimissionem Magistri Willelmi Cunynghaine nune prepositi et possessoris eiusdem, ad
presentationem Domini Regis et collationem Archiepiscopi Sancti Andree spectantem,
etc. Apud Linlithgow xvij Februarii Anno Domini Im v⁰ xxxviij. Per Siquatzwam.”⁴
In the following year however he had resigned the office, apparently on being pro-
moted to a wealthier benefice, as Commendator of the Abbey of Dryburgh. (Lib. S.
Marie de Dryburgh, p. xxiii.) The deed of eollation of his successor as Provost⁷ ex-
pressly bears that the office had become vacant by the pure and simple demission “ per
Thomam Erskyne clericum, ultimum p1·epositum.”

Mr. Rossnn'r ERsmNE, Rector of Glenbervy‚ was the next Provost of Trinity College.
He was a younger son of John Erskine of Dun. He was educated for the Church at
