of Paistoun, Thomas of Cranstoun‚ Duncan of Swanystoun‚ and Mariot his
spouse, Walter of Soltre a burgess of Berwick‚ and John the Marischal of
Keith. It is interesting also to find among these benefactors, in 1294, a
name of peculiar interest in the literary history of Scotland, Thomas of

Ereildoun, son and heir of Thomas Rymour of Ercildoun, the celebrated
Scottish poet, familiarly known as Thomas the Rhymer.

The original Chartulary is a very small folio of twenty-seven leaves
of vellum, the last much mutilated. It was transcribed from the original
Charters by William of Cranystoun, Notary Public, as appears by the
Instrument‚ printed as No. 55, at page 48, dated at the Church of Pencait-
land, the oth of February 1399-1400, in which the titles of the preceding
charters are specified. The charters are engrossed without any apparent
regard to chmnology, and few of them bearing the date, an attempt. has
been made to remedy this defoct by rte-arrangement, and the period of
their probable dates is given in the Tabula, within a parenthesis. Of this
register, on account of its antiquity, a notarial transcript was made by
George Newton‚ for the use of the Provost of Trinity College‚ according
to his attestation, dated loth of August 1516. The ancient Register belongs
to the Faculty of Advocates. Newton’s transcript, which remains among
the records of the City of Edinburgh, is a square folio of seventeen leaves
of vellum, each page being attested by him, in his official capacity as a
Notary. N one of the original Charters have been preserved.
