the Fourth, having in 1502, received ς5850 “1”οι ane >0ung gray horse,
brocht hamc be him furth of Flanders‚” &c. Iu a letter of James the Fourth,
1 lth January 1507-8, he is styled ‘⁴ Magister Jacobus Mercheinstone noster
familiaris.”1 He probably survived till 1526-7.

Sur Ronssar Cmmmaoss, chaplain to King James the Fifth, before he
obtained the Abbacy of Holyrood, in 1528, had been presented to the pro-
vostry of Corstorphine. The date of his investiture as Provost was the
5th of May 1527.² It may bc added, that in 1539, he obtained a giant of
the temporalities of the see of Ross, and 1n the following >ear was received
Bishop, and also held the Abbacy of Fearn ln commendam He died 30th
November 1545, and was buried in the Cbanonry of Ross.

Sia ALEXANDER Scorr, by the promotion of Abbot Cairncross, in 1528,
became next Provost of Corstorphine. The name was so common, that we
cannot presume to identify the persons of that name who incidentally are met
with towards the end of the fifteentb and first half of the sixteenth century.
It might have been the future Provost of Corstorphine (Dominus Alexander
Scott, presbyter) who obtained a presentation to the vicarage pensionary of
Glenquhome (in Peeblesshire), 6th April 1505.3 He at least was keeper of
the Rolls of Exchequer for many years, as we learn from pay-ments in the
Treasurer's Accounts between 1512 and 1542. On the 6th April 1529,
Sehir Alexander Scott, Provost of Corstorphine raised an action regarding
the crops of Ratho for this instant year 1528 3⁴ and on the Sth March
1529-30, he appeared before the Lords of Council to deliver “the evidentis
of the Lordship of Dirltoun‚'’ which had been in his possession “ for the
space of xii. or xiii. yeiris bigane.’'⁵ In Balfour⁷s Practicks, a case is quoted‚⁶
The King contra Alex. Forestar, Provost of Corstorphine‚ ]·2th March
1529, · but this is an evident mistake, as no such person was then Provost.
