TRINITY COLLEGE, EDINBURGH.

THE Collegiate Church and Hospital dedicated to the Holy Trinity,
Edinburgh‚ appears to have been projected if not founded by King James
the Second,l During his reign there existed no Collegiate Church within
the city, or in the immediate vicinity of Edinburgh. The premature death
of that monarch at the siege of Roxburghe Casae, by the bursting of a
cannen, on the Sd of August 1460, may have interfered with the neces-
sary arrangements3 but his widowed Queen, Mary, daughter of Arnold,
Duke of Gueldres‚ acting upon his intendem, became the actual foundress
of that establishment. The Papal bull of Pius IL, which authorized the
annexation of the Church of Soltre to the College aud Hospital newly
founded by the Queen, “de novo fundaverit, ac egregio quodam opere
construi edificari fecerit‚'' bears the date at Rome, 23d of October (loth
kalends of November) 1460, was promulgated by Andrew Bishop of Glas-
gow in the parish chureh of Linlithgow, on the leth of March 14451-2.
Its pious object was “the praise and honour of the Holy Trinity‚ and of
the always blessed and glorious Virgin Mary‚ of Saint Ninian the confes-
sor, and of all the saints and elect of G0d;” and likewisc the salvation
of the soul of the Queen's late husband, King James, of her own soul, and
those of her kindred, and of the present Bishop of St. Andrews, whose
authority she supplicated to confirm this endowment.
