DALKEITH. lxxxv

which had been founded by Sir James of Douglas in the Collegiate Church
of Dalkeith.

In the old Papal Taxations the churcli of Dalkeith is not included,
being still part of the Vicarage of Laswade which was rated at 1ΞΕΖΙΟ. Its
erection into a separate parish is detailed in an interesting local charter,
from which we learn, that in consequence of the inhabitants of Dalkeith
having represented the very great inconvenience and danger to which they
were exposed during tempestuous weather in having to cross the streams
that fell into the Esk, as they resorted to their parish church of Laswade,
about two miles distant, and alm, that the vicarage teinds were amply suffi-

with the tithcs of the three parishes of Newlands, Kilbucho, and Mording-
ton. As this charter of endowment is contained in the Morton Papers, vol. ii.
pp. 226-235, it was not thought necessary to swell the present volume by
giving more than the bull of erection of Pope Sixtus w. Alexander Gifford,
parson of Newbattle‚ having founded two additional chaplainries for the
altars of the Crucifix and of St. John the Baptist within the Collegiate
