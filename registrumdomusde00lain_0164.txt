KIRK OF FIELD.

PAGr. xxxw, line 1, add,—An annual pension of AE100,in the minority of King
J ames the Fifth, was granted to Mag. thnARD Bornwm. in utroque jure Doctor, for his
good and gratuitous services to us and our said tutor, John Duke of Albany, 20th
November 1520.

PAGE xxxvxL—ALEXANDER Fomuzs'r was educated at St. Andrews‚ where he took
his Master's degree in 1534. As the names Forrest, Forres, and Forret were sometimes
used indisffliminately, we may identify him with Mr. Alexander Forret, Provost of Foulis,
who sat in the Provincial Council at- Edinburgb in 1549. In deeds connected with the
New Foundation of St. Mary's College, St. Andreva, the name occurs of Mag. Alexander
Forres, prepositus de Foulis, 26th June 1550, and of Mag. Alexander Forrest, prepo-
situs Ecclesie beate Marie de Campis oppidi Edinburgensis, 25th February 15534. In
a contemporary MS. we find under the apparent date 20111 March 1555, at Rome.
· Item, apointed with M. Johnne Row for the Provostrie of the Kirk [of] Field, and caus
M. Alexander Fortes send his mandat 1ο ratify the xx lib. pensioun reservit to the said
Mr. Jol1nne.''—(Makkison's MS. p. ⁶250, quoted iu M‘Crie's Life ofKrzox, vol. ii. p. 291.)
Ι presume the meaning is, that Row had been appointed to negotiate at the Court of
Rome for Forrest, 1101 that he himself had ever been Provost.
