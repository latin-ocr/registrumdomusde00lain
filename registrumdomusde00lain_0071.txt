TRINITY COLLEGE, EDINBURGH. xxxi

detailed account of the Hospital‚ with the Rules for its government, states
that it was rebuilt in 158T.¹ In the meanwhile the inmates were dislodged
and became out-door pensioners, thus infringing or annulling its consti-

the two female skeletons—-the one in the mortuary chapel‚ as it was called,
on the north side of the church, the other, some months afterwards, within
an antique-shaped leaden coffin, in the Apsis, near the place where the
High Altar must have stood, and which two distinguished medical professors
concurred in stating was that of a female probably of about thirty years of
age, but, as they conjectured, of weak intellect. The matter being brought
before the Society of Antiquarie5‚ Ι was led to investigate the history and
character of the Queen Dowager; and the result of this inquiry, proceeding
upon contemporary authority, was, that however much the Queen may have
