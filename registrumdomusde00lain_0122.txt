lxxiv CORSTORPHINE.

ton, 23d January 1584-5, according to his Confirmed Testament by the
Commissaries of Edinburgh, leth November 1586. In his latter will, he
desires to be buried in the College kirk of Corstorphine. Mention is also
made of his children, and of James Douglas father brother to the Laird of
Corstorphine. His library was very select, consisting only “ of xij bukis of
Scriptum, and aucht bukis of prophane authors’'—one of which he thus
bequeaths: “Item, to the Lady of Corstorphing, ane buik callit Chaser
[Chaueer Ρ] quhilk the yung lady has borrowit fra him.”

Mr. ALEXANDER M‘GIL1,‚ Advocato, was probably but a youth when he
obtained a presentation to the Provostry of Corstorphine. From the pro-
ceedings in 1623, already mentioned (p. lxviii.)‚ we learn that Sir James
Forrester of Corstorphin “then remaining in the parts of France‚” had
appointed as his Commissioners Sir Lewis Bellenden of Auchinoull, Justice-
Cleri—ki, Mr. David M‘Gill‚ King’s Advocate, and Thomas Inglis, portioner
of Auldliston 3 and they lost no time in granting this presentation‚ on the ‘23d
of January 1534-5, being the same day when Douglas died. At the same
time letters were granted in favour of the said persewar and his said
umquhill father (Mr. David M‘Gill) as lawful administrator for his mitres,
&e.‚ for the crop of the year 1585. It would however seem that M‘Gill
had derived but small emolument from the presentation, since he required,
after a lapse of forty-three years, to institute legal proceedingS‚ to ascertain
froin the foundation chartei· what rights, δια, belonged to him as Provost3
and to this circumstance we owe the preservation of the chartei· itself.——
For minuter information respecting the chief persons and families, and
other matters connected with Corstorphine, Ι may refer to the account
of the parish in the New Statistieal Account, prepared by Thomas Thomson,
Esq„ W.S.‚ to whom Ι have been greatly indebted in the course of the
present investigation.

It only remains to add, that for several years after the Reformation,
Corstorphine was not recognised as a separate parish, being again reckoned
as a dependency of St. Cuthberts‚ having a Reader, with a stipend of 3813,
