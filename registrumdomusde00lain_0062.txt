xxiv TRINITY COLLEGE, EDINBURGH.

JOHN Dmmmm, his immediate successor as Provost was evidently the
same with Sir John Dingwall who is mentioned by Κηοιι.2 John Dingwall,
whose name appears in the list of Licentiates of the University of St. Andrews‚
in 1474, was probably the father of the Provost, as Buchanan expressly says he
was a priest’s son. In confirmation of this, we find in the Privy Seal Register‚
this notice, “ Preceptum legitimationis Donum JOHANNIS Dmowssm capel-
lani, Henrici Dffigwell, Jacobi Dingwell (and three sisters)‚ fratribus et
sororibus bastardi, &c‚” but the father’s name is not specificd, lst January
1511-12.2 His designation‚ sometimes as Dominus, sometimes as Magister,
might suggest more than one person of the name3 but by attending to
his various titles, as he enjoyed a plurality of offices, we arrive at a ‹lif-
ferent conclusion. Among the auditors of the High Treasurer’s accounts,
13th October 1516, he is styled ‘⁴ Dominus Johannes Dignvale, Archidia-
conus Cathanensis.” Having acquired by purchase from one of the burgesses
of Edinburgh, a house and garden in the vennel of the Collegiate Church
of St. Mary in the Fields, he is called “Magister Johannes Dingwall, Sedis
Apostolice Profflonotarius, Ecclesiarum Moraviensis Rossensis et Catha-
nensis Succentor, Thesaurarius, et Archidiaconus ;” and in fulfilment of this
purchase he became bound to pay the annual sum of 26s. sd. to the Provost
and Prebendaries of the said church, dated at Edinburgh, Sth of March
wls-9 ; two of the witnesses were ‘ Magistri Matheus Ker, predicte ecclesie
collegiata prepositus, et David Vocat, eiusdem ecclesie prebendarius, Scolae-
que principalis Grammaticorum Edinburgi preceptor.'' In 1524, Dominus
‚Iohannes Dingwall, Rector of Strabrok and Archdeacon of Caithness‚
obtained a charter, under the Great Seal, of the mansion and orchard of
Wester Strabrok in Linlithgowshire, 15th September, and on the 19th
November he conveys the said mansion, &c.‚ by a deed of mortification in
favour of the Rector and Vicar of Strabrok.³ Towards the end of 1525,
Dingwall succeeded as Provost of Trinity College. Upon the institution
