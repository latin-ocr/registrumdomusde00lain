xcvi · ROSSLYN.

Cathness‚ Norway, or some other family,” διε.1 But the entire building,
like so many others of the same age, was never completed, as the nave was
never begun, and of the transepts the east walls only were erected. Be-
sides the high altar, there were three others dedicated respectively to St.
Matthew, St. Peter, and St. Andrew, and another in the sub-chapel to the
Virgin Mary. The endowment originally consisted of the church lands of
Pentland‚ four acres of meadow, with the kips [or jutting-points of land],

Sinclair of Rosslyn granted other portions of land in the neighbourhood,
for erecting dwelling-houses with gardens to the provost and prebendaries.

page 327.

The “Genealogie of the Sainteclaires of Rosslyn, including the
Chartulary of Rosslyn‚” forms part of the collections of Father Richard

is also included in the Great Seal Register, and two dceds of 1571 and
1572,2 he says, “I think that the other charters relating to Pentland,
and the Chapel of Roslyn, may be found in Comiston's hands, or in
Sir Alexander Gibson of Pentland's charter-chest, or els amongst my Lord
Sinclar's pape1·s.''3 A considerable portion of the charters thus transcribed
by Father Hay are in the possession of Professor W. E. AYTOUN, who
most kindly and liberally gave the use of them, but, for the reason just
stated, they unfortunately were less serviceable for the present work than
I could have desired3 aud inquiries in other quarters for any ecclesiastical
deeds have proved unsuccessful.

The loss of these earlier deeds connected with this Collegiate church
has, no doubt, deprived-us of much interesting information 3 and I have been
