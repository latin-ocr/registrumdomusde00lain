RESTALRIG‚

AcconmNG to the legendary history of the Blessed Virgin T1·iduan‚
Lestalrik or Restalrig, in the vicinity of Edinburgh, might claim an
antiquity coeval with the metropolis itself. She is said to have come from
Achaia, in the fourth century, in company with St. Regulus, and to have
died at Restalrig in the year 510, in the reign of Eugenius the Third, the
Sth of October being held as her festival day. Although no precise date
can be assigned when a church or chapel was first erected and dedicated
to this Saint, whose bones for many centuries were held in high venera-
tion‚1 or when it first became the parish church of Leith‚ we can trace
it back at least to the twelfth century. The names of some of the
early rectors or vicars of the chureh, during the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries, may be found in the Chartularies of Dunfermline‚ Neu-battle,
North Berwick, and the Priory of St. Andrews. Adam, parson of the
church of Lastahigg, in the county of Edinburgh, swore fealty to Edward
the First in 1296.2 In the Taxation of Ecclesiastical benefices in Scotland,
which was prepared about the same period, the “Ecclesia de Lestal-
rige,'' in the Deanery of Linlithgmv, is valued at <5819, 4s. 2d.‚ and the
