CORSTORPHINE. lxxiii

On the lOth January 1540, Sir Alexander scon, Provost of Corstor-
phine, founded a chaplainry at the altar of John the Baptist, St. Christo-
pher the martyr, and St. Ninian the confessor, in the ehurch of Irvine.¹
About the same time, a letter of King James the Fifth‚ under the Privy
Seal‚ was “maid to Schir Alexander Scott, provost of Corstorphine, in
his latter days,’' and in consideration of his long, faithful, and daily service,
“ in all sessionis, chekkeriS, and register‚’' since the death of James
the Fourth, in 1513, and of his present inability “to ordour his benefice
as deuitio requiris‚'’ he received “free licence, liberty, and will to use and
dispone upon all his benefices, rentiS, possessionis, and takis quhatsumevir
as he thinkis maist convenient and profitable.”² In the Treasurer's Accounts
for 1520· aud subsequent years, his name occurs as one of the Auditors, and
as such he signs the Accounts rendered thh August 1542. He probably
died in the course of that year.

Mr. JAMES ScoTT, who succeeded to the Provostry of Corstorphine in
1543, was the third son of Robert Scott of Allanhaugh and Whitchester. He
was educated for the Church, and, in the reign ofJames the Fifth, was Clerk
to the Trcasury. In September 1533, there was paid “to Master James
Scott be the Kingis precept, and of consideratioun of the Lordis (Auditors)
for his labouris in the Kingis materis, 4:13, 65. 8ᾶ.” For his employment
“ in dyting of the Rollis'’ of Exchequer‚ his annual fee was ³813, (J's. Sd.
After he became Provost of Corstorphine, he was, like his predecessor, one
of the Auditors of the Treasurer's Accounts (from 1544 to 1562) 3 and in
the year 1554 he was appointed one of the Ordinary Lords of Session. He
died in the autumn of 1563. He built, at Corstorphine, a house or manse
for himself and successors, on which his arms, as Sir Robert Douglas men-
tions, are still to be scen.³
