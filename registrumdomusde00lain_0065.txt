Sm Gemma CLAPPERTOUN‚ one of the Prehendaries of Trinity Col-
lege in the year 1520, was Subdean of the Chapel Royal of Stirling3 and
from 1538 to the death of James the Fifth in 1542, he appears in the Trea·
surer's accounts as “ Maister Elimosinar (Almoner) to the Kingis Grace.'’
Dominus Georgius Clappertoun, in July 1540, as above, secured a presen-
tation under the Privy Seal to the Provostship of Trinity College near
Edinburgh, and by that title he sat in the Provincial Council held at
Edinburgh in 1549.2 In a note to Knox‘s History of the Reformation,³ I
was lcd to conjecture that Clappertoun had resigned this office upon being
appointed to the Chapel Royal‚ but, as already stated, he had been Sub-
dean for several years, and the collegiate accounts prove that he continued
Provost till at least the 5th of September 1566,4 when he probably resigned
in favour of his namesake, and no doubt relative, Laurence Clappertoun.

From the Register of confirmed Testaments in the Commissariat of
Edinburgh, we learn that “Sir George Clappertoun, Subdene of the
Kingis Majesties Chapell Royall of Striueling, deceissit in the moneth
os Apryle 1574.’' His nomination of Mr. Robert Pont, then Provost of
Trinity College, as one of his assigneeS‚ may be held as evidence of his
having embraced the reformed doctrines.

LAunssNcr: CLAPPERTOUN appears to have held the office only about
