ment of chaplainries for the maintenanee of daily stated service, always
including prayers and singing of masses for the souls of the founders, their
relations, and benefactors. In scotland, in more recent times, the term
Collegiate was applied to a Church where two ministers served the cure
as colleagues 3 but it had previously borne a different and wider signification.
These Collegiate Churehes, called Proeposituroe, were instituted for seeular
priests οι· canons, and for ehoristers, and were under the jurisdiction of a
Dean 01· Provost3 and the service regulated very much as in a Cathedral.
Each of these churehes consisted of a certain number of Prebendaries or
Canens, where they had their several stalls, and with their Dean or Provost
made up the Chapter. Most of these establishments, there is reason to be-
lieve, had existed as chapels οι· parish churehes, long before they were thus
enlarged and endowed by the great lauded proprietors in the neighbourhood.
