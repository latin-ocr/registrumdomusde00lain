RE STALRIG.

Tenths at «ΕΙ, les. 5d.¹ In the older Taxation, it is rated at 25 marks.
The names of barons of Lestalrig of that ilk also occur, before the pro—
perty passed to the family os Logan of Restalrig‚ who appear more dis-
tinctly towards the close of the fourteenth century as superiors of Leith.
Sir Robert Logan‚ knight, Admiral of scotland, was the founder of the
preceptory and hospital of St. Anthony in‘Leith. In 1435, an extra-dona-
tion of the right of patronage of the church of Restalrig was conferred on
Thomas Logan of Restalrig, by William‚ Bishop of St. Andrews.² The
connexion between Restalrig and Leith was further strengthened by Royal
donations. There was a spacious building near the mouth of the harbour,
occupying a large extent of ground between the Broad Wynd and Bernard
street, usually considered to have been a royal residence, and always
designed The King's lVark. N one of our local writers, in tracing its his-
tory‚³ seem to have been aware of the date of its erection3 but this is clearly
ascertained by the following payments entered in the Exchequer Rolls of
King James the Second :—

Two deeds, printed iu the Lsber Cartarum Sancte
Crucis, throw some light 011 1119 history of this pro-
perty. In 1450, J ames the Second grants to 1119 Monks
os Holyrcod his lands commonly called the Kinyis Inche,
lying in the lordship of Bothkenar, in the sheriffilom
os Strwelyn, in cxchangc for the Monks’ land lying in
1119 town of Leith in the barony of Lestfflrik, formerly
alienates} hy the Monks to a certain progenitor of 1119
ang. The other, of 1119 same date, by James, Abbot of
Holyrood, describes the lunds in Leith as that land now
vommonly called The Kinqis Werk, lying on the south
side of the water os Leith, &c.—(Pp. 141-144.)

scribing some boundaries, mention is made ’“ inter 191-

The King's Work did not escape the general con—
flagration of Leith by the English dun'ng the two inva-
sions of the Earl ofHartford (asterwards Duke of Semer-
set) in 1544 and 1547. On the 21st of October 1564,
‘¹ the landis cellit the Kingis wei-k of Leith, with the
houssis and biggingis being thairon, which were brint
and desti-oyit be our auld inemics of Inglaml, 1119 tyme

Comptroller); and he having repaired or re-edified what
was ‘¹ alluterly (lecayit,⁷’ 119 obtained a new infestment
os the same from the Queen in 1567. Some years later,
James the Sixth erected into a free barony, the King’s
XVork with its gaulon, and 1119 waste lands surrounding
it, in favour of Bernard Lyndsay os Lochhill: and its
subsequent fate is recorded in 1119 works abore men·
tioned.
