RESTALRIG. lxiii

Peter Falconer of Leith granted an annuity of 13 marks for supporting a
chaplain at St. Peter’s altar3 and in 1499, when Gilbert Edmonston of
Leith‚ bestowed 12 merks of rent to St. Barbara's altar.¹ In an instrument
of seisin, in favour of William Lauder and his spouse, the property is
vdescribed as eontiguous to the churchyard of “tlte Nem K‘irlc of tlze Blessecl
Virgin Margs in Leith‚'' 3d of November 1496.² On the 2d of August 1501.
John Logan, patron of the altar of St. Roche the confessor, situated 'in nova
ecclesia Beate filarie de Leith‚ presented Sir Patrick Matheson to the chap—
lainry of that altar, then vacant by the death of Robert Cairns.³
It has already been stated, that the General Assembly in 1560, when
ordei-ing the Chureh of Restalrig to be destroyed, enjoined the parishioners
to repair to the church of South Leith. But they appear to have considered
this a hardship3 and among· other matters submitted hythe Provincia] Synod
to the Genera} Assembly in October 1583, it is recorded, ‘⁴ Of old, Leith
and R-estalrig wes one parish‚ and the parish kirk stood in Restalrig3 while
now by the Act of the Assemblie it is ordained to be iu Leith‚ and yet Restal-
rig refuses, in respect of old alledged priviledges. Aozswen Ordains the
Presbytrie of Edinburgh to tak ordour heirwitl1.”⁴ It was not however
until 24th June 1609, that South Leith was erected by Act of Pax-liament
into a distinct parish, and St. Mary's Chu1·ch declared to be the parish
ehurch, and “ the kirk of Restalrig to be suppressed and extinct from hence-
forth and for ever ;” and that the benefice of Restahig, parsonage thereos,
with the glebe and manse, pertain to the minister of Leith.⁵
The first Protestant Minister of Leith‚ Mr. DAvm wansm, was the
son of Robert Lyndsay, who was slain at Pinkie in 1547, a younger son
of Walter Lyndsay of Edzell in the shirc of Angus.⁶ He early em-
braced the reformed doctrines, and at the nomination of ministers to the
chief towns, in July 1560, he was appointed to Leith‚ his stipend 300 merkis;
