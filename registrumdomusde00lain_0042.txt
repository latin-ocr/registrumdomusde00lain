vi THE HOSPITAL OF SOLTRE.

de concilio Walthevi abbatis de Menos, rex Malcohnus fundavit nobile mo-
nasterium de Cupro in Augus, et ante lzoc COENoan DE SOLTREY, ad via-
tores lzospz'tandos.'’1 But the King's charter, which contains a grant of the
lands of Brotherstanes extending to Lynden on the road to Roxburghe‚
being the earliest of the present series, has no date, and makes no allusion
to the Hospital as having been newly founded. The period of his reign
however was from May 1153 to December 1165. Tradition is also
favourable to his elaims as founder, as it is alleged he conferred on Soltre
the privilege of a sanetuary3 a road through Lauderdale (a name given to
the western part of the county of Berwiek) leading towards Soltre was known
as Malcolm’s road, and traces of it are said to be still visible 3 while another
road or causeway through the moors towards Meli-ose acquired the name
of the Girthgate‚ gale signifying a road, and girtli an asylum or sanctuary.'“'

The following account of Soltre, from Father R. Augustin Hay's “ Scotia
Sacra.,” an unpublished work, compiled in the year 1700,3 may be quoted,
as furnishing some minute particulars regarding the Hospital and its loca·
lity which are not elsewhere to be met with. He commits, however, a palp-
able mistake in saying that David, Earl of Huntingdon, was buried at
Soltre in 1219. The words in the Scotichronieon to which Hay evidently
refers, apud abbatiam de ,Santrez‘a sepultus,4 unquestionably apply to Sawtrey‚
a Cistereian abbey in Huntingdonshire.
