RESTALRIG. li

Mr. Patrik Covyntre, Dean of the Collegiate Church of Restallryg,
was one of thirteen ambassadors for negotiating a treaty of peace with Eng-
land who obtained a safe-conduct from Henry V111.‚ Gth February 1515-6.1
Judging from the date of his successor in the Deanery, we may conclude
that he died about the year 1524; and in consequence of some special
endowment, we find it stated, in 1539, that the services of the vicar of
Strathevin (in the presbytery of Hamilton) included prayers “pro anima
quondam venerabilis viri Magistri Patricii Covintre Decani de Lestalrig.'’2

Mr. 'W1LL1AM GfflsoN, second son os Thomas Gibson, the ancestor of
the family of Gibson of Durie in Fife, became successor to Covyntre as
Dean of Restalrig about the year 1525. He received his education at the
University of Glasg0w‚ where he was incorporated in 1503, and took his
Master's degree in December 1507.³ He afterwards obtained the vicarage
of Garvock‚ and in 1518, we find him styled Rector of Innerarity.‘² His
name as Dean appears as a witness to a deed on the 12th of April 1526.⁵
He was nominated one of the Senators on the Spiritual side, when the
Court of Session was instituted, 27th of May 1532 3 and from the Acts of the
Lords of Council and Session he seems to have taken a regular and active
share in legal matters. On account of his extensive abilities he was,
according to Douglas, frequently employed by King James V. in embassies
to the Pope, who honoured him with the armorial bearing of three keys,
and the following motto, Coelestes pandite porz‘oe; and adds, that as a
reward for his writings on behalf of the Scottish Church, he obtained the
title of Custos Ecclesioe Scotioe.⁶ In May 1540, the Dean of Restalrig
became Suffragan to Cardinal Beaton, retaining the benefices which he
already held, and to receive in addition a pension of two hundred pounds
during his life. In the letter addressed by the King to Pope Paul III.
requesting the sanction of his Holiness to this arrangement, Dean Gibson
