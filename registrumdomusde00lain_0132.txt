lxxxiv DALKEITH.

within the precincts of the Castle at Dalkeith a chapel dedicated to the
Virgin Mary and St. John the Baptist. Sir James of Douglas, first Lord of
Dalkeith‚ in founding a ehaplainry there out of his lands of Louchurde and
40s. annually out of Kirkurde, enjoined that, should the said chapel be under
repair, the chaplain should perform his stated service within the chapel
of St. Nieholas, or, in the event of war rendering this impracticable in
either place, within the parish church of Lesswade.¹ The charter is dated
5th December 1384. Sir JameS‚ as he advaneed in life, was not un-
mindful of this chapel. The two interesting documents purporting to be
his Latter Will and Testament, dated respectively 3oth September 1390
and 19th September 1392, are well known, and, it has been remarked,‘-’
they “ are better calculated to convey a just notion of his rank and impor-
tanee as a Scottish baron, than any historical document that remains to us.''
By the first of these ‹leeds he bequeathed his best horse and <2810 to the
Vicar of Leswade; and besides a cup and a missal, the sum of ..E-20 for the
reparation and roofing of the chapel of St. Nicholas of Dalkeith. By the
second, after payment of his debts and numerous legacieS, the above be-
quests being repeated, he assigns the residue of his goods to the fabric
and ornament of the said chapel‚ to the support of the poor, and to the
payment of chaplains for two years after his decease. He survived however
to the year 1420, and was enabled to raise the chapel to the rank of a
Collegiate Church, and probably to see the buildings nearly completed‚
having, with the consent of Henry lVardlaW, Bishop of St. Andrews‚ pro-
vided out of his lands stipends and manses for a provost and five preben-
daries as perpetual chaplains, as detailed in his charter, dated 21st June
1406ss Sir lValter Scott of Bukcleuch on the 25th January 1449-5o‚ with
the consent of his eldest son and heir, David Scott, granted a renunciation
of his superiority over the lands of Lochurd and Kirkurd in favour of
John of Balkasky and his successors chaplains in the prebend of Kirkurd‚⁴
