TRINITY COLLEGE, EDINBURGH. xv

terms recites the foundation of the Church and Hospital by James the
Second and the Queen Dowager, magnifico et sumptuoso opere, and con-
firms the transfor os the Hospital of Soltre, and of the cliapcl of Uthe-
rogali, in the county of Fife, upon the petition of the Queen and her oldest
son, King James the Third. The later bull, also of Popc Pius ΙΙ., is dated
6 kalendas Septembris 1463. It contains a grant of plenary indulgence
to all persons who should in a devout spirit of contrition visit the Church
in the course of five years, during thc feast of its dedication, on the lOth of
July‚ or the following week, called its Octavcs3 and the period was to bc
further extended every five years, until fifty years had expired. Occasions
of this kind wcrc eagcrly embraced, and crowds resorted from all quarters

confirmation, and of the Papal bulls‚ are for the most part extremely inac-

an accurate text. The second Register is a folio volume preserved in
the City Archivcs. It commences in the year 1504, and is peculiarly
interesting, as furnishing the occasioual proceedings of the Chapter, with
accounts of reccipts and expenditure until the year 1531, attested by the
original signatures of the Provosts and Prebendaries for the time3 besides
copies of later deeds and acts continued till 1586.

From other sources fortunately wc derive some information regarding the

progress of the building. During the Queen Dowager’s life, the work had
