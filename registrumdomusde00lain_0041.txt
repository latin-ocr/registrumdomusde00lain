THE HOSPITAL OF SOLTRE.

IN former times, one of the chief thoroughfares from the South led over
Soltre or Soutra Hill, on the Western bouudary of the county of Hadding-
ton. This hill, about seventeen miles from Edinburgh, is the highest elevation
to the west of that ridge or chain of mountains known as the Lammermuir
Hills, separating Lothian from Lauderdale. It is a dreary part of the
country, surrounded by bleak moorlands, and used to afford only scanty
pasture for sheep, until the modern improvements in agriculture have
brought some considerable tracts under cultivation. Near the summit of
the hill, or 1184 fect above the level of the sea, was the site of the ancient
Hospital and Church of Soltre. This Hospital, dedicated to the Holy
Trinity, was one of those religious establishments, of which a considerable
number existed in different parts of the kingdom,1 during the Middle Ages‚
having been erected and endowed not only for stated religious service, but
for the benevolent purpose of maintaining a certain number of indigent
and infirm persons in the surrounding district, and of receiving for a
limited period, pilgrims and other travellers.

The Hospital of Soltre is usually said to have been founded by King
Malcolm the Fourth, in the year 1164. For this statement, the oldest
authority seems to be the continuator of the Scotichronicon, who wrote
about the middle of the fifteenth century. His words are: “Anno 1164,
