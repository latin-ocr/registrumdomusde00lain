’ Ι11 noticing the destruction of this venerable Church, it would be foreign
to the object of the present work to enter upon the vexed question of its
proposed restoration. When it was scheduled for railway purposes, the in-
difference shown regarding it by the inhabitants can only be accounted for
by its unfinished appearance, as seen when looking down upon it from the
North Bridge, and their ignorance of its interior, which has been described by
an eminent architect as “ a very beautiful decorated composition, with the
capitals of the piers enriched with foliage, not exceeded in design or exe·
cution in any English cathedral.” After some further description of the
mouldings, the south door and open porch‚ &c.‚ it is added: “ This build-
ing is 311 of good decorated character, and is deserving of minute examina-
tion and study.”¹ But the Railway Directors nevertheless felt assured of
obtaining the building at their own valuation3 the minister of the ehurch
and the members of Presbytery deluded themselves with the dream of a
inore advantageous site and a showy edifice, while the majority of the
Town-Council‚ with all their elamorous anxiety for the good of the parish,
were most willing to erase the church altogether from the roll of their
ecclesiastical patronage. What therefore could a few Antiquaries expect
to accomplish 111 their desire to avert such an act of barbarism,2 more
especially when Government, after being appealed to, refused to interfere
for the preservation of this Royal foundation, since it had become one of
the parochial churehes of the city, and the parties concerned had con-
sented to its destruction?

Trinity Hospital and gardens also shared the same fate. The original
building stood in the neighbourhood of the ehurch on the eastern side of
Leith Wynd3 and Maitland in his History of Edinburgh‚ who has given a
