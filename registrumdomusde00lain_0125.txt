GREYCHTOUN.

CREYcH'rotm, Kreittoun‚ or Crichton‚ is a parish in the Presbytery of
Dalkeith, about twelve miles S.E. from Edinburgh. The Castle, an impos-

of about twenty miles falls into the Forth at Tyninghame. The church
of CreychtunQ which had been a rectory from an early period, in the

fifteenth century, when it was erected into a Collegiate charge. It appears
