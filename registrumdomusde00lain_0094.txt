xlviii RESTALRIG.

Bishoprick for one year, dated lst of May 1507. It only remains to add,
that Alexander Fresale, burgess of Linlithgow‚ obtained from King Jamcs
the Fourth a chartei· of two-third parts of the lands of Arbole in the carl-
dom of Ross and shire of Irwerness, which had fallen into the King’s hands
“ ratione bastardiae Joannis quondam Episcopi Rossensis,'’ loth August
1507.

The Bishop of Ross was perhaps succeeded in the Deanery of Restalrig
hy MR. HENRY WooD. In the Register of the Privy Seal,¹ is this notice :—
“ A presentation to Mr. Henry Wood of the Dcanery of Lestalrig‚ quhen
it sal happin to vak be promotion of Mr. Jo. Fresal to the Bishoprick of
Rosa or be resignation or dimission of him. De data x Septembris, Anno
domini, etc.‚ lxxxxvij [1497] ct regno Regis x. per Signaturam: gratis.''

No particulars regarding XVood have been discovered. On the suppo-
sition that he was duly inducted to the Deanery, he had for his successor,
ΜΓ. Rosam· Boswssm„ a Canon of Dunkeld. His name as Dean of Restal-
rig occurs in the same Register, in a precept of confirmation to lValter
Cargill, of a charter “ indentata per Magistrum Robertun] Boswell,
Decanum de Lestalrig‚ Canon. Dunkeld. ac Prebend. de Fongort,” δια,
16 November 1507.62 Myln, in his Lives of tho Bishops of Dunkeld, written
in the year 1515, and dedicated to Bishop Douglas, and the chief persons
connected with the cathedral church, includes Boswell prebendary of Fon-
gort, as an open-hearted‚ hospitabl‘e man (liberali et magnarum expensarum
viro), who completed the mansion house of his prebend, and other build-
ings; and he informs us he was a son of Boswell of Balmuto„ Mr. Robert
Boswell‚ parson of Auchtelderran, is stated to have been the son of David
Boswell by his second marriage with Lady Margaret Sinclair, daughter of
william, Earl of Orkney and Caithness.³ Such a parentage was likely
enough to insure his church preferment. His birth may be placed about
the year 1458. The name of Ro. Boswel appears first in the list of Deter-
minants i11 1475, and Mr. Ro. Boswell dives in that of the Licentiates‚ in
