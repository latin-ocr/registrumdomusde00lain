Dr. JonN Summam, a younger son of Sir Oliver Sinclair of Rosslyu,
was educated at St. Andrews‚ and obtained the Deanery of Restalrig sub-
sequently to his appointment as an ordinary Lord of Session on the Spiritual
side, 27 th April 1540. On this occasion he took his seat on the bench as
Rector of Snaw3 and he appears as such in the Minutes of the Court until
May 1542, after which there is a blank in the Register. It is probable,
therefore, that Gibson was dead before 1545, Sinclair having been ap-
pointed Dean, and Mr. John Spittall succeeding him as Rector of Snaw.‘·'
In the Privy Seal Register is the following notice :—

The Dean of Restalrig, in Foxe’s account of the trial and condemnation
of Adam Wallaee in 1550, is mentioned as ‘⁴ a worldlie wise man, and not
ungodlie in understanding of the truth.’'⁴ At a later period <under the
year 1557), Knox says, “ that perfyt hypocryte Maister John Sinclare,
then Dean of Restalrige‚ and now Lord President and Bishop of Brechin,
began to preach in his Kirk of Restalrig3 and at the beginnyng held him—
self so indifferent [impartial], that many had opinion of him, that he was
nott far from the kingdom of God.”⁵ And again, he speaks of him, “ blynd
of ane cie in the body, but of boith in his saule.’'6 *Having attended his
