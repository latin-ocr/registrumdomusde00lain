CORSTORPHINE. lxxv

6s. ed. At length, in eompliance with a memorial presented to the Pres-
bytery of Edinburgh‚ 1‘2th March 1587-8, this object was effected. To
establish the claim for Corstorphine that it was of old a parish ehurch‚ Sir
James Forrcster had referred to various (leeds 111 1115 possession, and he was
directed to produce them at a subsequent meeting3 when, ‘⁶ sycht and in-
spectioun being taken be the Presbyterie of sindrie foundations of the said
paroche kirk of Corstorphine, with bulles and other ryclitis, it was found,
that the Kirk of Corstorphine is of old a Parochc kirk, unto the quhilk the
Presbyterie interponis thair authoritie,’'¹ &c. Sir James, who died 4th
June 1585),2 was succeeded in his estates by his brother, Henry Forrester.
Mr. Andrcw Forrester‚ the first incumbent, was provided to the vicarage of
Corstorphine, vacant by the decease of Adam Bishop of Orkney, last vicar
thereof, ‘25th January 1593-4. The present building then became the
parish chureh, and has so continued to the present day. According to the
following extract from the Kirk Session book in May 1646, a new isle
was erected, most probany on the site of the old parish chureh, which was
then demolished, and the repairs or alterations made at that time may

account for some of the existing auomalies :—
