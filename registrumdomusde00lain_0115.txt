CORSTORPHINE. lxvii

super compotum xx li.’‘1 The right of patronage at least was eonferred on
Sir John Porrester, who had granted three acres in the village for erecting
houses to the chaplains, with pasturage for three horses and three cows.
On the same day (25th February 1425-6) Sir John endowed‚ with «ἕὸ, 13s.
4d., a chaplainry at St. Ninian's altar in St. Giles's ehurch, Edinburgh, for
prayers for the welfare of the King and Queen, and for the souls of the late
Sir Adam and of Margaret F orrester, his father and mother, and of Mar-
garet, his deceased spouse.2 Sir John at this time was Master of the
King’s Household and Great Chamberlain of Scotland.

The second charter of Corstorphine church was evidently the one by
which Dame Margaret Forrester‚ Sir Adam’s relict, who still survived,
and Sir John, their son, bestowed an annual rent of 2821, 135. 4d. for the
support of two additional chaplains and two clerks in the same chapel of
Corstorphine. It was confirmed on the26th May 1429. The erection of
the Collegiate Church is usually assigned to that year, when the build-
ings were commenced, as the inscription on the first Provost expressly
states, “istud collegium incepit A. D. 1429.” It seems, however, from the
Papal bull in 1444, that the foundation of the Collegiate Chureh was only
then completcd. In Sir Lewis Stewart’s MS. collections‚ so often quoted
for transcripts of old ecclesiastical deeds‚ there is an abridged copy of the
Corstorphine charter of 14443 hc has also preserved this inaccurate title
of what may be called the second foundation chartei· : “ Fundatio Ecclesie
Collegiate de Corstorphin [per Johannem Forrester?] militem, ab Henrico

and to have been succeeded in the office of Chamberlain by James Lord

appointed Master of the Household (Magister Hospicii), 1424. In the
