Faculty of Arm, St. Salvator’s College, St. Andrews, Sth October 1457, and is stylcd

Lasswade, Tth March 1501-2. Mag. WVillelmus Nudry was Vicar of Lesswffle, leth
November 1529.

After the Reformation in the parochial divisione and arrangements‚ various changes
were made in the appointment of ministers and readers in this district, some of which
bave already been speeified. From its connexion with Restalrig and Dalkeith‚ ir may
be added, that the old church of Lasswade having become unfit for public worship, the
present large and commodious edifice was erectcd in the year 1793. The minister of the
parish, in the Statietical Account, sayS, with some complacency, ‘⁴ The church now erecting,
in point of accommodatiori and magnificence of structure, will far exceed any modern
country chin-ch in Scotland ;” and liis successor, in the New Statistical Account, conjoins
the new church, the manse, and the ruins of the old chureh, as ‘⁶ the three objects forming
a group remarkable for its beauty.’' Passing over “the magnificence of structure’' of
the ehurcli, we are more concerned with the ruins of the old building (apparently a
structure of the end of the fourteenth century), portione of which were fortunately allowed
to remain, and are partly used for private burial vaul‘oe. A picturesque view of the
church from the south bank of the Esk, from a sketch by Mr. Clerk of mdiu, in 1776,
before it was concealed by houses on the opposite bank, will be tcund among “ The
Eldin Etcliings,” l'late xlvii. The accompanying wood-cut is reduced from a charming
drawing made a few years ago by Mr. James Drummon(l‚ R.S.A.
