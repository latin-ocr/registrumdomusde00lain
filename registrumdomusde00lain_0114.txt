rester‚ mercator de Scotia.¹ He was Alderman or Provost of Edinburgh
in 1373, 1:378. and 13873 he also held several offices of trust ; and was taken
prisoner at the battle of Homildon Hill in 1402, but was speedily ransomed.
About the same time he obtained the honour of knighthood. He died ou
the 13th October 1405, and was probably interred in a chapel, dedicated
to John the Baptist, which he himself had founded beside the parish church
of Corstorpbine. His widow survived him for many years. The service
of his sou and heir, Sir John Forrester, is dated 6th November 1405ss
On the outer wall at the west end of the helfry, or the detached building-
used as the sessim-house, there is inserted a stone with a monumental in-
scription to Sir Adam Forrester.

The first charter of donation and confirmation by King James the Pii-st,
of 24:24 for the endowment of three chaplainries in the chapel eontiguous to
the parisi] church of Corstorphine, is dated at Edinburgh, 25t11 February
1425-6. Of this endowment, according to the terms of the charter, the
sum of 2820 was bestowed by the King himself, and not simply paid out of
his coffers by way of compensation3 with the additional sum of 264 (cou-
sisting of two payments of 535. 4d.‚ and 26s. Sd.) from annual rents in Edin-
burgh, bestowed by the late Sir Adam For1·ester.³ In like manner, in the
Chamberlain Rolls, in the account rendered by the Ballivus of Edinburgh,
‘leth May 1434, the discharge includes “Et tribus capellanis per Regem
fundatis in capella beati Johannis Baptiste contigua ecclesie parochiali de
Corstorphine percipientibus annuatim viginti libras de firmis dicti burgi de
Edinburgh, δία, xx 1ἰ.”4 But among the unprinted Exchequer Bous, in
the year 1500, we find, “Et Preposito et Canonicis de Corstorphine per-
cipientibus annuatim vigint-i libras ex concessione domini Johannis Fores-
tair et confirmatione domini Regis Jacobi primi ut patet in rotulis prece-
dentibus dictis Preposito et Canonicis per suas literas fatentibus solutionem
