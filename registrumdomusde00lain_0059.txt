TRINITY COLLEGE, EDINBURGH. xxi

Trinity College Church, as above stated, was never completed according
to its original design3 but the accounts of revenue and expenditure of the
Chapter, between 1504 and 1531, included in the present volume, afford
sufficient evidence that considerable progress had been made in the build-
ing during that interval. No. 31 is an indenture or contract with Robert
Dennis, mason, who, for the annual fee of 226, and a bounty, agreed “ to
labour and remain for his lifetyme in all maner of labouris concerning his
craft to and for the said College :⁹⁹ it is dated 8th of April 1531. Sub—
sequent accounts to 1551 are not recorded. But the loss of the entire
Register, between its foundation in 1462 and 1503, is much more to be
regretted. These later accounts, however, show that the interior of the
church must have been ornamented in a manner suitable to the beauty of
its architecture. Payments are made for rich covers to the high altar, for
curtains of plesance with silk fringes above the head of the Virgin3 for silvei·
chaliees, reliquaries, cups, and other vessels for Divine service; also for
organs, and bells great and small; and there is mention of images of the
Blessed Virgin and St. Margaret. These with the ornamented service books
have long since disappeared3 but there has fortunately been preserved a
painting which there is reason to believe was the Altar-piecfflof that church.
I allude to the Diptych, or folding doors, painted on both sides, containing
portraits of King James the Third, and his Queen, Margaret of Denmark.
This precious work of art, painted about the year 1484, is now, by Hau
MAJEs'rY’s gracious permission, restored to this country, and exhibited in
the great Picture Gallery of Holyrood Palace? In a communication read
to the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland,1 after the painting had been trans-
ferred from Hampton Court, where it was all but overlooked, Iendeavoured
to prove its original purpose, by identifying the portrait of Edward Bonkill
the Queen’s confessor, and probably that of Mary of Gueldres herself, in
the character of an angel seated at the organ of the chureh, which forms
