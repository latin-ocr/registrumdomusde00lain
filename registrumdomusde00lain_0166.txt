In the same Register (fol. 6) there is a long letter, in Latin, of the same date, ad-
dressed to the Pope, soliciting his Holiness to grant his authority for completing the
proposed arrangements. It is uncertain whether the application was successful ; we
know at least that Sinclair not only retained the title and continued 10 001 as Dean, but
also received the fruits of the benefice till the year of his death in 1566. His promotion
to the See of Ross a few months previously may perhaps have led to his resignation,
but it was no doubt in consequence 01 1110 above-mentioned negotiation that Mr. J AMEs
LAUDER at length became his uncle’s successor as Dean of Restalrig. See p. liii.
