ROSSLYN. xcix

Father Hay addS, “the subscrivers can scarcely writt.’' It is more re-
markable from the circumstance, that Robesoun alludes to his having held
the Provostship for several years, and that, owing partly to the distracted
state of the country, its revenues had been withheld. There may have
perhaps been some contending claims between Dickson and Robesoun. In
the latter deed, it is stated that the Provost and pmbendaries, considering
the obligations they were under to Sir William Sinclair, had conveyed to
his son and heir Edward Sinclair, the kirk-lands of Pentland‚ &c.‚ for the
annual sum of five pounds usual money of Scotland, and also engaged to
furnish eighty sheaves of straw from the tithes of the parish church of
Pentland, to support the cattle employed in tilling the said lands.—“ Sir
Johne Robesoun, Provest of Rosling, persone and vicar of Paintland‚ dwell—
and in the town of Dalkeith,'’ died 25th April 1583.1

After the Reformation‚ no provision had been made for supplying
Rosslyn with either a minister or a reader. It was considered to form
part of Pcnssand, and the parish of Lasswade at that period consisted of
three parishes united, Lasswade, Melville‚ and Pentland with the Provostry
of Rosslyn. Nor was it indeed until the year 1835, that Rosslyn was erected
into a quoad sacra parisb, and disjoined from Lasswade. But without enter-
ing upon its ecclesiastic-al state, it may be notieed, that the Synod of Lo-
thian and Tweeddale, 5th May 1590, directed Oliver Sinclair of Rosslyn “ to
be called before the Presbyterie of Dalkeith‚ for not permitting George
Lundie (who had recently been appointed minister), to resort for the dis-
charge of his office to the kirk of Pentland.” At a subsequent meeting of
the Synod, reference is made to former ordinances, which enjoined the said
Presbyterie “to tak ordour with the Lard of Roslingfor keipv'ng images and
uther monumentis osidolcztre'e in liis kirlc‚” and also “ to tak ordour with him

Laird of Rosling declared to the Syn0d‚2 “ he was nane of the parochinaris
