Mr. GEORGE RAMSAY was presented to the Deanery of Restalrig‚
with the same reservation of Elphinstoun’s pension‚ 25th October 1575.2
About the same time he was also admitted minister of Dalkeith, Laswade‚
and Glencorse ε 1115 stipend “the haill twa-pairt of the Denerie of Restalrig
quhairunto heis newlie provided, 264, 45. 5d.‚ 1 chalder, 12 bollis quheit,'' ἃς.
In order to obtain possession of the various deeds connected with the
Deanery, Ramsay instituted an action before the Commissaries of Edinburgh
against Sir William Sinclair of Rosslyn‚ into whose hands they no doubt
came upon the death of the Lord President. The decreet of the Com-
missaries contains an inventory of the several documents which were then
produced and transferred to the new Dean. It is curious and worth pre-

serving in this place :—
