ROSSLYN.

T HE Collegiate church of Rosslyn is situated on an elevated ground
called the College Hill, overlooking the North Esk, about seven miles to
the south of Edinburgh. It is a very common but popular error, even with
writers like Sir lValter Scott, to speak of this charmingly decorated example
of ecclesiastical architectum as merely a chapel. It is occasionally so
called in old deeds, but we have no indication of any separate chapel of the
name, and from the first it was desigued as abCollegiate ehureh, dedicated
to Matthew the Apostle and Evangelist. The establishment consisted of a
promst, six prebendaries, and two singing boys or choristers. According
to the varied accountS‚ it was founded in the year 1440· by William St. Clair‚
Earl of Orkney and Lord of Rosslyn. It is singular that the foundation-
charter should not have been recorded, nor has any copy of it, after a long
search, been discovered. There can, however, be no doubt regarding either
the name of its founder or the time of its erection. It is sufficient to state,
that the continuator of the Scoticlzrom'cmz, circa 1447, in his list of Praefec-
ειη-ιε sive Proepositmw, sayS‚ “Dominus VVillelmus dc Sancto Claro Comes
Orcadiae est in fabricando sumptuosam structuram apud Roslyns’ W'e might
conclude from this notice that considerable progress had already been made
in the building.

This powerful nobleman succeeded his father Henry, second Earl of
Orkney, in the year 1420. His first wife was Dame Elizabeth Douglas‚
formerly Countess of Buchan, and this lady is usually said to have erected
the sub-chapel‚ which was entered by a flight of steps near the High Altar,
