xxxviii THE KIRK OF FIELD.

Kirk of Field, and we are thus furnished with the name of the next Provost‚
Pssmvcmzss. . . . ¹ On the 5th of March 1562-3, “ the Provost, Baillies,
and Counsale ordainis Maistcr Johnne Spens baillie, Andro Murray of Blak-
barony, and Maister Johnne Prestouu thesaurer‚ to talk and commune with
the Persoun of Pennycuke tuiching the Kirk of Feild and hail bigingis
thairof.” On the 2151: of June, in the Council Records we have the terms
of a contract by which ‘⁴ . . . Pennycuik‚ persoun of that ilk, and Provost
of the Kirk of Feild,” for the suni of one thousand pounds Scots agrees to
transfer to the Town “ the hale bigging sumtyme callit the Kirk of Fei1d‚
bayth auld and new, with kirkyard, lugingis, &c., that pertenit of before to
the Provostrie and prebendars of the samyn.” Farther, on the eth of Octo-
ber, a connnittee was named “ to tak inspectioun of the Persoun of Penne-
cukis evidentis of the Kirk of Feild, &c., with all diligence, sua that the
said Persoun have no farder cause to complene of delay.”²

Four years later, we find that Mr. ROBERT BALFOUR, brother of the
notorious Sir James Balfour of Pettindreich, was Provost of St. Mary's in
the Field‚ when the Provost's house, on the night of the 9th of February
1566-7, was blown up, with the view of concealing one of the most extraordin-
ary tragedies that any age or country has witnessed. This was the murder,
hy Bothwell and his accomplices, of Darnley‚ who had been lodged in
the Provost’s house, and where, only a few hours before, Mary Queen of Scots
had visited her husband. This atrocious event, and its consequences, are
too well known to require any details, but it has attached an imperishable
interest to the spot where it occurred. For the purpose of conveying an
accurate idea of the scene, a rough but spirited sketch of the Kirk of Field,
and the adjoining localities, was hastily taken and transmitted to the English
Court. It is preserved among the correspondence of the period in H. M.
State Paper Office, and, by perinission, an accurate facsimile of this very

curicus drawing is here given, on account of local interest.³
