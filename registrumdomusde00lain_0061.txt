TRINITY COLLEGE, EDINBURGH. xxiii

March 1471-2‚ the name of “ Sir Edward Boncle‚ Provost of the Colledge
of the Trinite beside the burgh of Edinburgh‚'’ appears in an action and
summons before the Lords Auditors for certain sums due as maiis to the
Kirk of Sowtra.¹ It also occurs in other two cases, l3th October 1474),2
and 13th April 1485.3 From the phrase in the two Exchequer Rolls
of 1496, tanc preposv'ti,4 and quondam, we learn that Bonkill was then
deceased. The name of his immediate successor as Provost from 1490
to 1502, if any one was appointed, has not been ascertained.
The next Provost of whom we have any notice was Mr. JOHN BRADY.
He was apparently a native of Lothian, and was educated at St. Andrews.
The name ιῘο. Brade occurs in the class of Determinants in 1478, and
M. Jo. Brady in that of Licentiates in 1480. At a meeting of the Uni-
versity, held on the 2d of J anuary 1489-90, he appears among the deputies
of the district of Lothian ; and he became Archdeacon of Lothian. Brady,
who is styled Parson of Tannades, on the 13th February 1500-1, received
a presentation to “the channonry and prebend of Crechmond within the
Cathedrall Kirk of Aberdeen.‘’⁵ In the Register of the Privy Seal in 1502
is the following entry :—“ A presentatioun to Master Jo. Brady of the Pro-
vestre of the Trinite Collegc besid Edinburgh withe a claus in the samyn
that the vicarage of the Wemys salbe annext perpetualle to the Provest of
the said College and his successouris, διο. De data primi Septembris anno
Domini vc and twa yeris. Et regni Regis xvii. Gratis. per Signaturam.”⁰
Brady, who continued to be styled “Archdeane of Lowthyane,” in the
year 1511, as Provost‚ gave in a propine to David Beton the sum of 44
French crowns‚ to obtain a new confirmation of some of their lands, and
to prevent the same being granted in feu to courteours.⁷ From this period

till his death in November 1525, he appears to have exercised a constant

and diligent superintendence of the College.
