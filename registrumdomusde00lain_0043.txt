B. M. V. in Campo. Xenodochium mole et operis munificentia longe maximum in praeruptis mon-
tium, loco nimium patenti brumae incommodis juxta publicam stratam, advenis per Regnum iter
facientibus aedificatum, de consilio Waltheui Abbatis (MS. de Capro). Quos benigne et comiter
exceptos ac tridui quiete refectos dimittunt. Addita hospitio aedcs sacra, eique perampla aedifieia
adjuncta puerorum receptaculo⁷ qnos magno numero Legis Doctoribus in disciplinam tradunt.
Pecunia ad tantos sumptus faciendos partem ex constitutis Imperii vectigalibus et aerario erogata
partem ex adventitiis fructibus quaessta, qua liberalitate Numen maxime propitium, labesque
ex noxas animo conceptas, expiari creditum. Locus pervius patebat utrinque transmeantibus
peneque jugiter multitudine comeantium frequentatus legitur in medio duarum Provinciarum.

Pringle. His residence is att Meusdenhead, a mile distant from the Hill. His buriall place is in
ane Isle of the Abbacie which is now decay¹d; the ruins only being conspicuous. The Hospitall
stood on the East of the Highway as you come from Edinburgh sor Kelso; on the West there
are att this day some Cotter houses. The bnilding appears to have been very spacious. About
the midle hill towards Lothian near to the highway, there is a fountain called Ternity Well or
Trinity Well. On the south side of the hill att the soot there is a small brool< which divideth
Lothian from Lauderdale. There is a village likewise distant from the Monastery about a mile

and a half nam'd Sowtry3 it is probable it belonged of old to the Hospitall.
