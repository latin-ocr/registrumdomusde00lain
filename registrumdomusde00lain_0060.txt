According to the Queen's foundation, in 1462, confirmed by Kennedv,
Bishop of St. Andrews, the Chapter of Trinity College consisted of a Pro-
vost, eight prebendaries, and two choristers or singing boys. The first
prebendary had the title of Master of the Hospital of the Holy Trinity, the
second was called the Sacristan, the others were the Prebendaries re-
spectively of 3. Browderstanis, 4. Strathmartin‚ 5. Gilstoun‚ 6. Ormistoun,
7. Hill, and 8. Newlands, being so named after the places from which the
chief source of revenue was derived3 but which it is not necessary in this
place to reeapitulate. Their duties are also accurately defined, and strict
rules prescribed to enforce residenee and propriety of conduct.¹ The Pro-
vost was enjoined to be present at all festivals3 anniversaries were to be
observed on the obits of the Queen, of the late King “our most tender
lnlsband‚” and of Bishop Kennedy. Each prebendary was also directed,
whenever he said mass, that he should, in his sacerdotal habits, repair to
the tomb of the Foundress with hyssop, and there devoutly read the prayer
De profundis, with an exhortation to excite the people to devotion.

It has already been stated that the first Provost of Trinity College
was EDWARD BONCLE or BoNKlLL. His title, Dominus or Sir, as applied
to priests, shows that he had not taken the higher degree of Master of
Arts3 but he was a person of distinction. I find from a notice acciden-
tally preserved that he was admitted a guild-brother of the town gratis in
1459, in acknowledgment of his aid and counsel.‘·' It is most probable he
was from the first connected with Edinburgh. In addition to the notices
of Bonkill which occur in the Exchequer Rolls, already quoted, on the 3d
