lxx CORSTORPHINE.

Nmuoms BANNACHTYN or ΒΑΝΝΑΤΥΝΕ, was the first Provost of the
Collegiatc Church. He pursued his studies at the newly erected University
of St. Andrews, his name occurring, as one of the Determinants, in 14:23,
and as a Licentiate or Master os Arts in 14:25. According to his monu-
mental inscription, he became Provost in 1429, the year in which the Col—
legiate Church is said to have been founded. We also find his name,
“Magister Nicholaus de Bannochtync, Magister in artibus, Propositus
capelle Collegiate de Corstorfine‚’⁷ occurring as a witness to an instrument
of seisin of the barony of Corstorphine‚ 15th September 1436} He filled
that office for nearly half a century 3 and in the inner wall of the chancel‚
apparently transferred from the place where he was buried, is the following
inscription :-——-

The last words Orate pro animabus eorum are scarcely legible, having
apparently been purposcly obliterated3 and the blank space on the stone
after the numerals M.CCCC.Lxx. may lead to the conjecture that the inscrip-
tion was prepared by Bannatyne during his own life, as he certainly sur-
vived the year 1470. This is proved by a charter of confirmation, under
the Great Seal, of a grant by William de Camera or Chalmers‚ Vicar of
Kirkurd‚ of certain lands in Corstorphine for sustaining a secular priest to
minister at the altar of St. Anne in the parish church, and one of the wit-
nesses was Mr. Nicholas Bannachtyne‚ Provost of the Collegiate Chnrch
of Corstorphine‚ <20th September 1473?

Mn. JAMES DOUGLAS was the next. Provost, but nothing is known re-
