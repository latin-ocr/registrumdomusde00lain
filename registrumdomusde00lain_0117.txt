CORSTORPHINE. lxix

Regarding the ecclesiastical buildings connected with Corstorphine
there is great uncertainty. The chapel of St. John the Baptist, founded
before 1405, is said to be contiguous to thc pal-ish church3 and the latter
is usually held to have been distinct from the College. The old church
in all probability, like most buildings of the kind, was of small extent, but
may have been enlarged from time to time in having such chapels attached
to it. No part of the present buildin‘g, as it now exists, is earlier than the
middle of the fifteenth century. Under each of two arched recesses on the
north wall of the chancel there are recumbent figures of a knight in armour,
and a lady, with armorial bearingS, carved on the front of these monu-
ments, which clearly indicate the two Sir John Forresters, who flourished
during the first half of that century‚¹ and lead to the conclusion, that the
monuments and this part of the edifice must have been subsequent to the
death of the second Sir John Fon—ester, about the year 1454. In a similar
recess in the wall of the south transept, there is another recumbent. figure
of a knight in armonr, said traditionally to be the monument of Bernard
Stewart, Lord of Aubigny, who came to Scotland in an embassy to> King
James the Fourth, but died at Corstorphine‚ within a short time of his
arrival, in the house ofArehibald Forrester, in June 1508. In his testa-
ment he expressly says,—“ Inprimis, Do et lego animam meam Deo omni-
potenti Beate Marie Virgini et omnibus sanctis corpusque meum sepelien-
dum fore in eeclesia Fratrum Nigrorum Edinburgi. Item, Lego in die
sepulture mee in funeralibus pauperibus aliis piis operibus et dictis fratribus
xiiij lib.”‘-' Agreeably to this request, we may conclude, that instead of the
church of Corstorphine, he was interi-ed in the monastery of the Black-
friars, Edinburgh3 more especially as the monument is unquestionably of
an older date, and the shields with arms indicate a Formam-,³
