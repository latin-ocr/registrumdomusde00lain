xcviii ROSSLYN.

wc find the name of ‘⁶ James Sinkler‚ son to umquhile Sir Olipher
Sinkler of Rosling knycht, Maister John Sinkler, slieref-deput of Edin-
burgh, in company with Sir Johne Sinkler‚ provest of Rosling, 13th Feb-
ruary 1541-2.’'1 John Sinclare, provost of Rosling, was presented to the
vicarage of Dummany‚ in the diocese of St. Andrews, 2d January 1547-8.2
His name also occurs as Provost in 1551 and 1553.3 Sir John Sinclare,
provost of Rosling, was presented to the chaplainry called Rom, within the
’ deanery of Gowrie‚ and diocese of St. Andrews, 7th July 1555.⁴ This
notice enables us to fix the period of his decease, as on the 20th September
1556 a new presentation was issued, “super capellania Roiss nuncupata,
infra diaconatum de Gourie, et diocesim Sanctiandree, nunc vacante per
decessum quondam ιῙοανιηῐε Sinclare ultimi capellani et possessoris ejusdem.”⁵
The name of the next Provost is somewhat uncertain, but we find that

5111 JOHN D1CKSON, Provost of Rosslyn‚ granted a chartei· of the kirk-
lands to Edward Sinclair, son and apparent heir of Sir William Sinclair
Baron of Rosslyn, Pentland, and Herbertshire‚ dated 28th April 1571. Η6
0311 scarcely be identified with the person who was Provost in 1523-4. On
the other hand

sm JOHN RonsssoUN, Provost‚ within ten months of the date of the
preceding deed, with the consent of the Collegiate chureh, assembled in
chapter, 011 the ⁵26th February 1571-2, made a similar or still fuller grant of
the kirk-lands in favour of the said Edward Sinclair younger of Rosslyn.
Both deeds are printed in the “ Genealogie of the Saintclaires of Rosslyn.”⁶
The latter is signed
