of the Kirk-Session of Leith, that forty years later a proposal for its restora-
tion was contemplated. Our Minister, it states, “ Mr. Alexander Gibsone,
this 29th of Aprill 1649, did intimat to our sessione, That the Presbyterie
of Edinburgh are of that mynd and purpose, with the consent of the Lord

the kirk and congregatione of South Leith.” The Presbytery Records are

this retired spot, being covered with turf and overshadowed with yew trees.
Although often said to have been the crypt or family vault erected by Sir
Robert Logan of Restalrig (who died in lamo-41), by whom indeed it may
have been built, while it has been used as such by successive proprietors,² it
was undoubtedly attached to the College, perhaps as the chapter-house, or
as St. Triduan’s chapel. The building is hexagonal, and is constructed in-
