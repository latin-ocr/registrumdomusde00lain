RESTALRIG. xlvii

Rolls and Couneil. In the treaty of Peace with England‚ 15th of June
1493, he was one of the Commissioners, and is designated “Magister
J ohannes F resale‚ Decanus Capelle Regie de Restalrig‚ Clericus rotulorum
et registri ac consilii.’'1 Under the same titles his name appears in the Acta
Dominorum Concilii, 1492 to 1495. In the Exchequer Rolls, 21st June
1496-21st June 1497, we still find “ Magister Johannes Fresale‚ Decanus
capelle regie de Lcstalrig.” A few months later he was promoted to the
See of Ross3 and in the Privy Seal Register is a precept for the admission
of John, Bishop of Ross‚ “to the temporalitie of all landis, rentis, and
possessionis thairof,” dated the 3d of J anuary 1498, Xim year of J ames IV.
That the Bishop of Ross was not Rector of Dingwall, appears from a
charter of confirmation, by which John, Bishop of Ross‚ grants to the
vicars and chaplains of the Cathedral Church of Ross‚ an annual sum of
³810 out of his property in Linlithgow‚ dated lOth May 1504, and one 01'
the witnesses to this deed is John Fresell‚ Rector of Dingwall.²

We may be excused in adding a few words regarding Bishop Fraser.
He was not unmindful of his former charge, having founded the chaplainr)⁷
of St. Triduan in St. Triduan's aisle in the Collegiate Church of Restalrig3
and Jamos the Fourth, by his eharter, dated lssth of October 1512,³ em-
powered the Abbots of Holyrood and Newbattle to erect it into a new
prebend. The Bishop finished the Cathedral of Fortrosc, and has the
report of having been a good hospitable man.4 He died on the 5th of
February 1507, aged 783 and a monument, with the effigies of a Bishop,
in pontificalibus, still preserved in that chureh, is said to be that of Fraser.
A letter under the Privy Seal was granted in favour of Sir Robert Fre-
sale, Dean of Βοεε, Alexander Fresale‚ and J ames Makyson, executouris to
