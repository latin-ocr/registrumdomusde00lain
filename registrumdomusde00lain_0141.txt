DALKEIT H. xci

1762, the building of a new stceple and spire for the church was authorized,
and the church itseff, in 1767, was directed to be repaired. In its old
state it was by no means a eomfortable place of worship, and required further
repairs. A picturesque view of the church, from a drawing by Mr. E. Blore,
illustratos the account of Dalkeith, in the Provincial Antiquities‚ published
in 1826. Sir WValter Scott there sayS‚ “The church of Dalkeith is a
Gothic building of very ordinary workmanship, of which tlte eastern end is
unroofecl and minoas, the walls serving, however, to enclose a burial ground,
containing the remarkable monuments of the Grahames, which have been
already noticed, from which opens the funeral vault of the family of Buc-
cleuch.'' This vault is the north aisle or chapel attached to the church,
as represented in the wood-cut vignette on the next page, from a drawing
by Mr. William P. Burton.

The accompanying ground-plan is reduced from drawings made by
David Bryee, Esq., R.S.A.‚ Architect, in 1854, when the church was at
length rcsolvcd to be restored. This was accomplished, chiefly at the
expense of the Duke of Buccleuch‚ under Mr. Bryce’s directions, the walls
having been ⁴ cased,’ the interior arrangements altered and rendered more
commodious, and a new steeple and spire erected in place of the com-
parativcly modern square tower and steeple. In this restoration the eastern
portion or ehanceL which, as not required for public service, had been
separated from the church by a partition wall, for at least two centuries,
was fortunately allowed to remain untouched in its old ruinous state. The
entrance or door-way to the south, with the walls and buttresses, being
still very entire, it is most desirable that this portion of the building should
not be allowed by neglect to go to destruction, which might be avoided
were a light roof thrown over it, the windows opened up and glazed, the
weeds and rank grass cleared out, and care especially taken to preserve the
old Douglas monument with its recumbent figures, which at present is ex-
posed to irreparable injury. By some unaccountable mistake Sir Walter
Scott has described this monument as two curious but wasted tombstones,
