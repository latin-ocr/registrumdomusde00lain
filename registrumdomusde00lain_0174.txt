was united to and under the jurisdiction of the minister of Heriot and Stow, with a reader,
James Gibson, who had the manse and glebe, and a stipend of 1220. By a charter, 4th
April 1596, King J ames the Sixth disjoined from the Collegiate Kirk of Creichton the
prebends of Arnetstone (now Arniston), Myddelton, and Vogrie, and two clerks3 and
these, with the whole vicarage of Borthwick, were erected into a separate benefice, as the
Parish Kirk of Borthwick. Thjs arrangement was ratified by Parliament, llth July
1606.1 But a few years later, 23d October 1612, Sir J ames Dundas of Arniston, Knight,
having represented to Parliament that the Kirk of Borthwick was ruinous, for the pur-
pose of “ uphalding it‚” it was enacted, that the part of it called the Revestrie, should
be assigned to him for a family burial-place in all time coming, in consideration of his
furnishing the expenses required for repairing the Church.² The Church itself was
destroyed by an accidental fire in May 1775, but the walls were allowed to remain, in-
stead of the customary practice of using the old stones for constructing some barn-like
meeting-house, which almost inevitably replaced the old ornamented Gothic church that
harmonized so well with the surrounding scenery. This old ruin is chiefly remarkable
for the aisle which preserves the sculptured figures of its founder, as is supposed, Wil-
liam de Borthwick, and of his lady, a Douglas. There is an engraving of this monu-
ment, from a drawing by E. Blore, in the Provincial Antiqujties.

ΜΓ. Adam Colt, minister, was presented “to the benefice and parsonage of the
parish kirk of Borthwick, newly erected.’' 12th May 1596.

LASSWADE.

prebend of St. Salvator’s church, but was annexed to the Collegiate church of Restalrig
in the reign of King J ames the Third. Mr. Walter Lyndsay, appears in register of the
