THE KIRK OF FIELD. xli

religious houses of the Blackfriers‚ Kirk—a-field, and Grayfriers‚ thought
it more safe for them to have the towne-wall ‹lrawin about without
them3 and so, drying the Cowgate Logh, they enlarged the towne on the
south syde. This Kirk-a-field stood along towards the east from the Pot-
terraw Port, haveing an gairden on the south, betwixt it and the present
towne-wall: On the east end thereof was the lodging of the Provost, where
now the Principall of the Colledge hath his rowmes3 and to the east from
thence (within the present colledge yairds)‚ were the prebendaries cham-
bers, blown up with fire at the mut-ther of King Henry3 and to this reli-
gious convent belonged all the Colledge yairds. For many years thereafter,
John Fenton keeped possession of the Provost of the Kirk-a-field’s lodging‚
and the yaird lying thereto.

plan of the College‚ as it was divided into an Upper and a Lower Court.
