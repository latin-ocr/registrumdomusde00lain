sists of a choir‚ with north and south tmnscpts, and a square towcr‚ the
nave of the original design having, apparently, from the changing fortunes
of its founder, been left unfinished. The evcntful history of the Crichtouns,
the Hepburns of Bothwell‚ and of other families connected with the
Castle and Barony‚ is fully related by Sir Walter Scott in the Provincial
