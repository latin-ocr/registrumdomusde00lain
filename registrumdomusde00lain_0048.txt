xii THE HOSPITAL OF SOLTRE.

actually beon taken down, when its proprietor interfered, and caused it to
be restored. It formerly belonged to the Pringles of Beatman's Aere, a
piece of land adjoining‚ bestowed, it is said, by Jamcs the Fifth, in consider-
ation of a night’s hospitality which he had received. A monumental stone
to some of the family, of a late date, is built into the gable of this aisle;
and over the entrance a large stone or lintel with the date and initials,
16. D. P. A. R. 86, marks no doubt the year in which this portion of the
old church was so appropriated. Mention is made in the various notices
of Soutra of a fountain of excellent water, dedicated to the Holy Trinsty,
and vulgarly called the Tarnity Well. This well, we are told, “though
it does not appear to have any medicinal qualities, was formerly much
celebrated and much frequented by sick and diseased pe1·sons.”1 In the
course of improvements it has also disappeared‚ the ground being under
ffillage, and the water carried off by means of tile-drains.

It only rernains to add, that the aisle above mentioned, which rises near
the top of the hill, now serves as a solitary beacon or landtnark to denote
the site of the ancient Hospmt and Cmmcn OF SOLTRE, which, for many
an age, before poors-houses and infirmaries existed, had continued to mi-
nister relief to the sick or destitute, while in such a sterile locality, it could

not but prove a welcome place of refuge for the weary pilgrim.
