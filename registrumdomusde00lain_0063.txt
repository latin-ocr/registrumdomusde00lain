TRINITY COLLEGE, EDINBURGH. xxv

of the College of J ustice in May 1532, Sir John Dingwall was one of the
J udges on the spiritual side taking his seat as Provost of Trinity College3
but he did not long enjoy this distinction, having died, it would appear,
within a few months of his promotion to the bench. On the 26th of July
that year, an action was raised before the Lords of Sessien by “ Sir J hone
Dingwell‚ Provest of the Trinite College besyde Edinburgh, for himself,
and as executour to umquhile Maister Jhone Brady his immediate prede-
cessour and Provest of the said College aganis Elizabeth Ker Lady Buk-
cleucht, and WValter Scott of Branxholme knycht, hir sone‚’' relating to
the arrears of teynd-schawis‚ and of the parsonage of the parish kirk of
LempetlaW‚ in the parish of Sprouston‚ Roxburghshire, “for the space of
xiii yearis immediatlie precedand and befoir the deceis of the said umquhill
Maister Jhone quhilk deceissit in the month of November the zeir of God
I¹¹¹ v⁰ and xxv zeiris.”1 On the following day, the 27th of July 1532, in a
similar action pursued against Sir William Scott of Branxholme‚² heis styled
Maister Jhone Dingwell, Prothonatour Apostolic, Provest of the Trinite
Collcge besyde Edinburgh3 but I have not observed his name entered as
present at any subsequent niceting of the Lords of Session, We may con-
clude, therefore, that he was deceased on the 16th November that year,
when James Beaton, Archbishop of St. Andrews‚ George, Earl of Rothes‚
and John, Lord Erskine, were admitted as Lords of Session, being chosen
by the King, ‘⁴ beeaus thais· is diverse (loide, some seik, and some away of the
said Lordis of Sessione, quhairthrow there is no sufficient nomber conforme
to the acte maid thereupone of before, to decyde on all matteris, and to mini-
ster justice to all his leiges.’'³ Buchanan, in one of his epigmms, founded,
he says, upon some hexameters written by Sir Adam Otterburn ofAuldhamc
and Redhall, knight‚ refers to the proud titles inscribed on Dingwall's sump-
tuous monument, and says he had acquired great wealth at the Court of

Rome in his official capacity.⁴
