lxxvi CORSTORPHINE.

The rest of the expensses for all other necessaris to the Kirk and Isle slaiting and all was
taken out of the box, be common consent, for the interim and promised to be put iu agane.

In agane to the box exeepting two hundreth pounds quhilk was delyvered be the minister
Mr. David Basilie to Andrew Rae, ane hundreth lib. at ane time in . . . qr Mr. James Wat-
sone and George Coehran were witnesses; and at another time fifftie lib. to the said Andrew
for timber, and fifftie lib. to John Waker for glase to mak vpe his comptis.

In the year 1828, when Corstorphine Church was again subjected to
the necessary but unfortunate process of restoration, we may regret that
its original form had not been retained, and that, contrary to all rules of
Gothic architectum, a doorway, with a small porch, should disfigure the east
wall of the chancel. But the primitive look of the church externally has to
some extent been preserved, the older portions still having the stone roof of
overlapping slabs of old grey flagstones‚ and the belfry-tower‚ with a short
octagonal spire, remaining unaltered. The plans, before such alterations
were made, have not been traced ; but the accompanying view of the church
is interesting as exhibiting its appearance in 1817, when the sketch was
made by JAMES SKENE of Rubislaw, Esq.‚ an accomplished amateur artist‚
who has preserved many similar views of ancient buildings in various parts
of the country, as well as in Edinburgh and its neighbourhood.
