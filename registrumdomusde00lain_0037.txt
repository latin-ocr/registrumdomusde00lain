PREFACE.

THE original design of this volume was to form a series of Charters
and other deeds connected with Tmmw Commi: CHURCH and Hospmn„
Edi‘nburgh, to serve as a companion to the similar volume of the ST. G1L1-:s
CHARTERS recently presented to the Members of the Bannatyne Club.
The Hospmt or SOLTRE or Soutra having been annexed to that
foundation, its Chartulary, hitherto unpublished, seemed naturally to form
the first portion of such a collection. The importance of the volume, it
was thought, might further be increased by attempting to collect the foun-
dation charters of other Collegiate Churches of the city and county of
Edinburgh, consisting of St. Mary’s in the Fields, commonly known as the
Kirk of Field, Restalrig, Corstorphine, Creichtoun, Dalkeith, and Rosslyn.
No separate Register of any of these Churches has been preserved, and
the few existing charters contained in protocol books, and other old tran—
scripts, for the most part occur in a very inaccurate or imperfect state.

In the Appendix to the Scotichronicon, as enlarged by Walter Bower,
Abbot of Inchcolnie, there is a list of Monasteries‚ Priories, and other
religious houses which existed in Scotland during the reign of King James
tho Second. Under the head Pam-Eorum, sive PRAEPOSITURAE, the follow-
ing sixteen Collegiate Churches are cnumerated‚ with the names of the
founders3 Abirnethy, Bothanis, Bothvill, Carnewith‚ Corstorphin‚ Dalkeith,
Dirltoun, Douglas [Dunglas]‚ Dunbar‚ Fowlis, Kilwinin [Kilmun] in Cowal,
Lyncloudan, Maybol, Methfven, Roslyn, St. Andrews. To two of these
Provostries a remote 01· fabulous antiquity is assigned, viz„ ‘⁵ Abirneffiy,
