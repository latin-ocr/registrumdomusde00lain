RESTALRIG. liii

brother Henry Sinclair‚ Bishop of Ross and President of the Court of
Session, in 1564, when he proceeded to Paris to undergo a painful surgical
operation ;1 on the leth September that year, Queen Mary addressed a
letter to Queen Elizabeth for a safe-conduct to Maister Johne Sinclair,
Dean of Restalrig, to return from France through England.² The Bishop
of Ross, after lingering for some months, died on the lst of January follow-
ing, and before the close of that year the Dean was promoted to the chair
as Lord President. About the same time he was also advanced to the See
of Brechin. But Sinclair did not long enjoy these honours, having died of
sever on the 9th of April 1566.³

Mr. JAMES LAUDE R, the next Dean of Restalrig, was second son of Robert
Lauder of Bass. It is a singular circumstance to find an Act of Privj⁷
Council, 13th March 1572-3, stating that “letters were raised at the instance
of Mr. J ames Lauder, Dean of Restalrig‚ against his father Robert Lauder
of Bass, who still detains him in strait prison in Beill-”4 The cause of such
imprisonment at Beill, his father’s residence in East Lothian, is nowhere
stated, but from some other unexplained reason he must have soon after
relinquished his office of Dean. It may be added in connexion with his family
history, that his elder brother, Sir Robert Lauder of Poppill knight, pre-
deceased his father, on whose death, in June 1576, J ames succeeded to the
property, but he was murdered by his servant in October 1580.⁵

Mr. Tuoms DoUGLAs had a grant of the Deanery of Restalrig, which
became vacant ‘⁴ by the simple dimission and resignation of Mr. James
Lauder, last Dean and possessour thairof,'' reserving a pension of 3100 to Mr.
Nicholas Elphinston, lOth November 1573.6 Douglas was minister of Stra-
brock, and was translated in the following year to the united parishes of Dal-
keith, Laswade‚ and Glencorse. He derived little advantage from such pre-
ferment, having died in June 1575. In his latter will, dated 20th May 1575,

Mr. Thomas Dowglas, Dean of Restalrig, constituted “ his spouse‚ Marion
