x THE HOSPITAL OF SOLTRE.

1452, promoted to the See of Dunkeld‚ as a reward for his services as
preceptor to King James the Second: he was then aged about 60.
Abbot Myln, in his Lives of the Bishops of Dunkeld‚ who passos a high
eulogium on Lawder as a person of great ability and piety, states, that hc
was the, first to introduce the custom of preaching in his diocese. Feeling
the effects of advanced age, in 1476 Lawder resigned the See in favour of
the Dean, James Livingston3 but he survived till November 14813 and
Myln has recorded the inscription on his tomb, in the Cathedral Church of
Dunkeld.1 It is probable that Lawder had resigned his Mastership on the
occasion of his being appointed Bishop in 1452, as we find ALAN CANT
styled Rector of the Hospital and Chancellor of the Church of St. Andrews,
apparently between 1453 and 1455.‘3 This designation renders it necessary
to explain, that Soltre Hospital was, by authority of Pope Nicholas V„
annexed to the Church of St. Androm, as the benefice of the Chan-
cellor, with the consent of Alan Cant, who then became Chaucellor. Cant
had pursued his studies at the University of St. Andrews, where he became
a Bachelor of Arts i111426, and a Licentiate in 1430. In 1460, we find
that he was deceased, and that his successor was JOHN Trux, Bachelor of
Dccrees.3 In 1479, John Tyry was one of thc Masters elected as assistants
to the Rector of the University of St. Audi-ews.

Upon the annexation of Soltre and its possessions, by Mary of Gueldres,
to the Foundation of the Trinity College, in 1462, its connexion with St.
Andrews was dissolved, and it was restored by Papal authority to its for-
mer state as an Hospital and Parish Church, under the charge of a Vicar,
who was appointed by the Provost of the new institution. JOHN Hemor,
Vicar of Soltre, is witness to several Charters in the year 1467ss In October
1479, Sir John Heriot, as Vicar, claimed having power from Sir Edward
Bonkill, Provost of Trinity College, to grant a lease of the tithes of Fawnys.⁵
