On the 3d of May 1506, Sir Walter Gray, chaplain in Lestalrig‚ was
allowed to set in feu-farm “ a land in the Cowgate of Edin‘. for xj merkis,

King James the Fourth was a chief benefactor, as appears from his
chartei· 18th October 1512,² having granted the annual sum of 2820, out of
the King's Work of Leith‚ for the maintenance of an additional chaplain3
and having also bestowed the parsonage of Bute, with all its revenues, to
be equally divided into six free prebends. In the charter of 1515,3 these
several foundations are recapitulated, and the stipends and duties of the
dean, prebendaries, and singing boys, specially defined3 and twelve
years later, the Rectory of Ellem was annexed to Restalrig by King James
the Fifth.

The following list of the DEANs OF Rx-:smmm may be considered as
complete.

Mr. JOHN Fmsm: or Fmsm, the first Dean‚ was a person of note, yet
thero is some uncertainty regarding his parent-age and early history. In
the Annals of the Fraser family he is said to have been a younger son of
Hugh, third Lord Lovat, educated at Oxford, and as Rector of Dingwall‚
before hc was promoted to the Deanery of Restalrig. Another authority
says, he was a natural son of Fraser of Fruid, in Peebles-shire‚ and a
Canon of Glasgow, Abbot of Meli-ose, in 1485, and Bishop of Ross, and that
he died in 1507, at the age of 78. In the Rogisters of the University of St.
Andrews, we find Joannes Fresaill among the Determinants in 147‘2, and
Mr. John Fresail, as Dean of the Faculty of Arts in 1479. He was, as
above stated, admitted to the Deanery of Restalrig when the Church became
Collegiate in 1487, Five years later he was appointed Clerk of Register
