lxxx CREYCHTOUN.

vost of Crichtoun was one of the Council who were appointed to assist
the Queen Dowager‚ after that fatal day of Floddon. Sir Thomas Hal-
kmstoun, Provost of Creychtoun‚ had a. letter under the Privy SeaL 22d
September 1515, with licence ‘⁶ to big fore-stayrs toward the hie street of
his land and tenement in Edinburgh.”¹ He also audits the same Accounts‚
3d October 1516; and again 4th September 1518.

Mr. GEORGE LOCKHART, the next Provost‚ was distinguished for his
learning and his writings on Dialectics and Philosophy. He was a native of
Ayr, and completed his education at the University of Paris; where for
several years he was Professor of Natural Philosophy in the College of
Montacute. In November 1521, “Magister noster Mag. Georgius Loekhart,
S. Theol. Professor, Praepositus de Crechton’' was chosen Rector of the Uni-
vcrsity of St. Andrews3 and again in the years 1522 to 1525. In January
1526-7‚ Robert (Schaw) Bishop of Murray issued a letter of commission to
the venerable and accomplished man Mr. George Lokcart, Professor of
Sacred Theology, and Provost of the Collegiate church of Coeychtoun,
relating to certain bursaries in the University of Paris which had been
founded by one of his early predecessors, a Bishop of Murray.² Lockhart
afterwards became Dean of Glasgom and from the Obituary of that See,
we learn that he died 22(1 June 1547.3

The name of Lockhart's immediate successor is not known. Several
years had apparently intervened before the office was conferred on Chalmer
who is next met with as Provost of Creichtoun.

Mr. DAvm CHALMER or Chalmers of Ormond, was born in the shire
of Ross‚ and was educated for the chureii, probably at King's CoHege,
Aberdeen. He procecded abroaid, says Dr. George Mackenzie, and studied
Tlieology and the Laws in Franoe and Italy.4 On his return to Scotland,

ho was successively appointed Parson of Suddy, Provost of Creichtoun‚
