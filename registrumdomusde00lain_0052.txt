xiv TRINITY COLLEGE, EDINBURGH.

St. Andrews‚ is dated the lst of April 1462, and recites the Queen's peti-
tion in which she states the purposcs of the new foundation, as a perpetual
College or Collegiate Church for a provost, eight chaplains or preben-
daries, and two choristers, to which there was to be conjoined an Hospital
for the support of thirteen poor persons named Beidmen3 while the sums
allotted to the Provost and other officials are specially enumerated‚ and
rules prescribed for the regular and efficient performance of their respec-
tive duties. The plan of the building was in the form of a cross-church,
of which only the choir, aisles, and transept were completed, with a south
porch, and a north chantry-chapel, all in the Second Pointed or Decorated
style of architectum. The site of the buildings was the low ground, with-
out the city walls, to the north-east, sheltered bytho precipitous rocks of
Calton Hill, as exhibited in the accompanying plan, copied from Gordon‘s

survey of Edinburgh‚ drawn and engraved in 1647.
