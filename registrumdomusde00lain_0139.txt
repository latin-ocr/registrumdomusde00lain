Among the Morton Papers there is a letter, dated eth October 1592,
addresscd to the Earl of Morton as patron of the Provostry of Dalkeith,
by Mr. William Scott‚² in favour of his brother-in-Iaw, Thomas Hamiston,
then younger of Priestfield. It states that Hamilton‚ who had been appointed
a Lord of Session, was desirous to acquire a ‘⁴ kirk-title’' or designation‚ and
the provostry being a benefice of small value‚ not exceeding 40 merks
yearly, he solicited his Lordship to sign the presentation, with the pro-
mise, “ that in all your reasonabill adois and causis he (the new Judge) salbe
your Lordship's gude freind.’'3 The arrangement of this matter had pro-
bably not been completed‚ as Hamilton, on the 9th November, took his seat
on the bench by the title of Drumcairne. He was created Lord Binning in
1613, and Earl of Melrose in 1619, afterwards exchanging the latter title
for that of Earl of Haddington.⁴
