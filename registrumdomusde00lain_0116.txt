lxviii CORSTORPHINE.

Scotiae) in May 1425, and so till June 14413 the Rolls for three or four
years of a subsequent date, which might have fixed the period of his decease,
being lost. That he was alive in 1444, when Corstorphine was erected into
a Collegiate Church, is at least highly probable: the continuator of the
Scotiehronicon, circa 1447, in his list of Collegiate Churches, names Cor-
storphine ‘⁶ cujus fundator dominus <Iohannes Forster pater ;” but this does
not imply his being then alive. His son, the second Sir John Fon-ester,
who had been infest during his father's life in 1430, is said to have died
before 15th September 1454, but this date is not well ascertained. We
find, however, that the grandson, Sir Alexander Fon-ester, was in possession
of the estates in the year 1463)

The third charter of foundation os Corstorphine incorporates the bull
of Pope Eugene IV„ already referred to, dated at Rome, 15th July 1444.
It states that Sir John Forrester had assigned the annual rent of 120 gold
dneats for sustaining the provost, four prebendaries‚ and two singing
boys, with the view of completing the Collegiate establishment3 and directs
l’atrick, Abbot of Holyrood, as his apostolic vicar, to unite and incor-
porate the chureh of Ratho, with all its rights and emoluments, to the
said College for ever, the additional chaplains to be maintained out of the
fruits of that benefice. In virtue of such authority, James, Bishop of St.
Andrews, on the 30th October that year, gave his sanction confirming the
proposed arrangements. The original (leeds are not known to be preserved,
but, on the δώ March 1628, an action was raised “at the instance of Mr.
Alexander M‘Gill‚ advocate, son lawfull to umquhill Mr. David M‘Gill of
Nisbet, sometime advocate to our Soveranis dearest father, against Sir
George Forrester of Corstorphin knight‚ patron of the Provostrie of Cor-
storphin‚ and haifar (possessor) of the foundation3'’ and the Third founda-
tion charter being accordingly produced, the Lords of Council ordained the
same “to be transumed‚”2 &e From the official transumpt then made,
compared with “this authentic copy⁹⁹ in the Register, it is now printed
