CORSTORPHINE.

THE parish of Corstorphine‚ anciently written Crostorfyn, lies in the
valley between the Pentland and the Corstorphine hills, about three miles
west of Edinburgh. Previously to the reign of David the First, in the
year 1128, when he founded the Abbey of Holyrood‚ there existed a ehapel
connected with the maner of Corstorphine, and subordinate to the church
of St. Cuthbert, Edinburgh. In the foundation charter‚ the King grants and
confirms to the newly-ereeted Abbey the ehurch of St. Cuthbert‚ under the
Castle wall of Edinburgh, with all its dependencies and pertinents, includ-
ing the chapels of Corstorphine and Liberton: “cum duabus capellis que
ad eandem ecclesiam Sancti Cuthberti pertinent, scilicet Crostorfin cum
duabus [sonatis terre et εει· acris, et illa capella de Libertune‚ etc.”¹ There is
also among the Holyrood charters, one of Normain', Shoriff (Vicecomes) of
Berewic, in the same reign, which conveys to the Abbot and Com-ent of
the Holy Cross of Edinburgh, ‘⁶ capellam meam de Corstorfin, curn omni-
bus rectitudinibus capelle eidem pe1·tinentibuS.’'² This chapel, we may
suppose, was afterwards known as the pai-ish church. The earliest Lords
of the manor upon record were the Marischels, succceded by the Mores of
Abercorn, until the year 1376, when the property was acquired by Adam
Forrester, an opulent merchantuburgess of Edinburgh. His name first
appears in the public records in 1362 ; and in the following year, with several
