THE KIRK OF FIELD. xxxvii

Collegiate Cllurch os St. Andrews, had been appointed Principal Official
before the lOth of March 1552-3.1

Mr. ALEXANDER Founsssw, who was edueated at St. Andrews‚ taking
his degree of AM. in 1534, is first met with as I'rovost of the Collegiate
Chureh, 18111 February 1553-4.2 In the following year, the Provost and
Prebendaries‚ granted a feu-charter of part of their property to James,
Duke of Chattelherault3 and one reason assigned is specially worthy of
notice, as showing that their buildings were in a ruinous state long before
the Reformers had commenced their labours for the purgation of idolatry :
“ considering (it is said) that their houses, especially the Hospital annexed
and incorporated with their College‚ were Imrnt down and destroyed bg] their
meld enemies of Ensslcmcl [in 1544-47], so tlmt nothing qf'tltec'r said hospital
was lest, but they are altogether waste and entirely destroyed ,· wherethrough
the Divine worship is not a little decreased in the College, because they
were unable to rebuild the said Hospital ;’' they had in consequence granted
in feu the tenement or hospital with the yards and pertinents thereos, to the
Duke, for the purpose of erecting there a mansion—house for his own use.³
ΜΓ. Alexander Feri-est, Provost of the Kirk of Field, appears, from an old
Inventory of the Town’s Charters, to have been alive in 1559.

After the Reformation, the various religious houses in Edinburgh hav-
ing been suppressed and the rights conveyed to the Provost and MagistrateS,
Knox and his friends urged them to appropriate such revenucs “for sus-
tenyng of the trew ministeris of Goddes word, founding, bigging of hos-
pitalis for the pure, and collegis for learnyng and upbringing of the youth,
and sie uther godlie workis.''⁴ But selfish interests, and the unsettled state
of the country interfered with these liberally dcx-ised schemes. It may, how-
ever, have been for the purpose, which was afterwards carried into effect, of

founding a College, that the Couneil resolved to purchase the rights of the
