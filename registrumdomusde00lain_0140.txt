xc DALKEITH.

In terms of the above Act of Parliament‚ George Ramsay and Archibald
Symson continued respectively parochial ministers of Laswade and Dalkeith.
Ramsay’s stipend‚ according to the Books of Assignations, was “the third
of the vicarage of Leswaid‚ with the haill personage and vicarage of Leswaid
and Glencorse.’‘ He still retained his title of Dean of Restalrig in 1600,
as noticed in the Appendix.1 From his confirmed testament2 we learn,
that ‘⁶ Mr. George Ramsay, sometime minister of Lessuaid‚'’ died on the
eth December 1629, leaving a widow, Margaret Murray: their marriage—
contract was dated at Dalkeith‚ lst September 1608.

In like manner, Symson's stipent] in 1596, was “the haill personage of
Dalkeith‚ 5393, Os. 8d.‚ the haill vicarage of Dalkeith, 313, ls. 8d., and the
third of the provostry, 38, lTs. ‘9ng He was the son of Mr. Andrew Sym-
son, one of the early Reformers, and a distinguished scholar, who was
successively‚ master of the grammar school at Perth, and at Dunbar‚ wherc
he was also minister till 1582. Patrick Symson, minister of Stirling, was
another son, of whom five entered the ministry‚ and all of them being zeal·
ous asserters of Presbyterian parity, they rendered themselves obnoxious
by their resistance to King James's scheme for introducing Episeopacy
into Scotland. Archibald Symson, minister of Dalkeith, author of various
works, died there in December msa—The succession of the ministers of
Dalkeith, continued to the year 1843, is very accurately given in the New
Statistical Account of the Parish.³ ’

After the preceding notices, it would be unnecessary to say much
respecting the old church of St. Nicholas.4 We cannot greatly err in
stating, that it must have been erected during the life of Sir J ames Douglas,
first Lord of Dalkeith‚ in the early'part of the fifteenth century. In the
year 1686, the minister having reported the church to be in a ruinous state,
the Presbytery ordered it “to be made wind and water tight.'’ Again‚ in
