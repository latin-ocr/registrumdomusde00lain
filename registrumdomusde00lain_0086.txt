xlii THE KIRK OF FIELD.

Fields had disappeared, when these additions and alterations were made
during the first half of the seventeenth century3 as in turn the whole of
the old College buildings have been removed in the course of thc present
century.

The original entrance, which led into the Lower court, was from the
north, immediately opposite the vennel which still retains the name of the
College Wynd3 and like that of Heriot's Hospital, it was surmounted with
a steeple, but no view of it has been preserved. This account was given
me by a well-known distinguished Physician‚ who was born within the walls
of the College in 1749, and survived till 1835. At a more recent period,
probably from 1789 till 1822, when the foundation of the present building
was laid, the entrance was from South College Street, by the gate repre-
sented in the subjoined wood—cut. The house to the left was that of Prin-
cipal Robertson‚ and afterwards of Professor Dalzel3 while the low range
of houses to the right, forming the south side of the quadrangle, had been
inhabited by some of the Professors; the one next the gate served as the
Senate·house‚ while the adjoining one was the birthplace of Dugald Stewart.
But all personal recollections of these buildings, and their varied associa-
tions‚ must necessarily, in the lapse of time, be soon effaced. The Founda-
tion itself has now, for nearly three centuries, continued to flourish, and
to confer no ordinary lustre on Edinburgh as a seat of science and learning.
