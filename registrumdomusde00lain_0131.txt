DALKEITH.

Tm: town of Dalkeith is situated between the rivers called the North
Esk and the South Esk, six miles from Edinburgh. It derived its chief im-
portance in early times from its baronial castle3 but, the male line of the
ancient family of Graham becoming extinet in the reign of David the Second,
tho property, and also extensive possessions in Liddesdale, came by marriage
to the noble and powerful family of Douglas. It is, however, sufficient in
this place to refer to the account of the Knights of Liddesdale and of
the Lords of Dalkeiffi, which Sir &Valter Scott has given in the Provincial
Antiquities3 and also to Douglas and Wood’s Peerage of Scotland, and the
notices contained in the Preface by Mr. Innes to the Morton Papers and
Charters‚ printed at the expense of the Bannatyne Club. But the early
history of the Douglases is still capable and worthy of further elucidation.

At an early period there existed in the town of Dalkeith a chapel
dedicated to St. Nicholas. Robert the Second, in thc second year of his
reign (1372 ‚ granted a license to James of Douglas to endow a chaplainry
in this chapel with the annual sum of AEss, 133. 4d. out of his Iands of
Horsbruke.1 Five years later, Sir James of Douglas founded another
chaplainry out of his lands of Quilt and Fethane.2 In August 1380, Wil-
liam Bishop of St. Andrews gave institution to Sir Richard Mellok of
Aberbrothok to a vacant chaplainry in the said chapel.3 There was also
