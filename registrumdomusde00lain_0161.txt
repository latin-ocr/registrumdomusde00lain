PAGE XXV1.—PRovosrs or Tnmrrr Connus, 1532-1540.-—1n consequence of
having mislaid some of my notes, when preparing this account of the Provosts, the para-
graph at the foot of the page, commencing with the words “Some uncertainty exists‚''
&Q should be deleted, and the three following paragraphs substituted :—

Mr. WILLIAM ΟυΝΝΙΝᾶΗΑΜ, the youngest son of William, fourth Earl of Glencairne‚¹
was educated for the Church, and upon the death of Sir John Dingwell‚ was preferred to
the vacant Provostry of Trinity Oollege, towards the close of 1532. He held the office
for nearly seven years. In a deed of William Earl of Glencairne, dated May 1538, his
name occurs as a witness, ⁴⁶ William Ounninghame, Provost of the Trinite College, besyd
Edinburgh ; ’' and again in another deed, “Pro Jacobo Naper et Mariota Quhite sua
sponsa‚” in February 1538-9‚ he is styled, “ Venerabilis vir WVillelmus Cunninghame pre-
positus Ecclesie Collegiate Sancte Trinitatis prope Edinburgh.”‘·' As there is reason to
believe that Cunninghame was promoted to the See of Argyle early in 1539, this will
account for his resignation of the Deanery at that time, when Thomas Erskine became
his suecessor; (See next page)-—Keith's account of the Bishops of Argyle is very
confused and inaccurate. It may therefore be stated that Robert Montgomery,
youngest son of Hugh, third Lord of Montgomery and Earl of Eglinton, was pos-
tulated to that See in 1525. At St. Andrews that year his name occurs among the
studeuts «ἰφι Pedayoqz'o, as “Magister Robertus Montgomery postulatus de Argyll.’¹
He appears as Bishop of Argyll (Episcopus Lismorensis) in a decreet-arbitral, 2d May
1530ss Instead of surviving till 1557 or 1558, according to Keith, he was dead per-
haps in 1539, but certainly in 1544, when three natural sons were legitimized, “filiis
naturalibus quondam reverendi in Christo patris Roberti Ergadie Episcopi.''⁴ King
dames the F ism, by the following letter under the Privy Seal, conferred on the Bishop
ofArgyle a very extensive right of presentation to vacant benefices in his diocese :—
“ ANE letter to WinLrAM BisoHoP or ERGYLE, gevand and committand to him power to
mak, direct, and gif vnder his awne sele and subscriptioun manuale letters of presentatioun
of all benefices pertenying to our Souerane Lordis presentatioun within the diocy of Ergile,
